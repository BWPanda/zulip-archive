<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am new to Backdrop CMS and like what I see so far.</p>
<p>My setup is ...<br>
Mac Retina, OS Yosemite<br>
Mamp 5.7<br>
Backdrop CMS<br>
FileZilla</p>
<p>I have no problem installing Backdrop CMS locally.</p>
<p>The problem starts when I try to install it on my internet provider's shared server.<br>
I use the same Backdrop zip file used for the local set-up.</p>
<p>Process ...</p>
<p>I first create a database and a user with full read/write access.</p>
<p>Then FTP across the backdrop zip file using FileZilla.<br>
Through my cPanel, I unzip Backdrop to my root folder designated for Backdrop.</p>
<p>I then go to my browser and type in my domain name "<a href="http://xxxx.com">xxxx.com</a>" where the backdrop files are.<br>
But get the following error.</p>
<p>"Internal Server Error<br>
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request."</p>
<p>So I type in the full installation address for Backdrop</p>
<p>"<a href="http://xxxx.com/core/install.php">xxxx.com/core/install.php</a>"</p>
<p>Again getting the same error as above.</p>
<p>I am assuming it is a folder/file permission access issue<br>
but don't know for sure.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me where my installation process is going wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Regards</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="367392">@esn</span> , what you see if you place to same directory instead unpacked zip just a file "index.html" with some string into?</p>

<p>Or file "index.php"  contained <code>&lt;?php phpinfo();</code> ?</p>

<p>Also, see if you can see what is in the Apache error and/or access log.</p>

<p>I too would start where <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268468">@Vladimir</span> suggested by testing if a .HTML file works, then a .PHP</p>
<p>Sometimes when adding an addon domain, Apache doesn't rebuild properly to recognize the domain. The other thing I to check is where the add-on domains folder is looking.</p>
<p>Question: do you plan to have or already have more than one site/domain? The primary domain on the account can cause problems if the files are in a folder inside /public_html.</p>

<p>Just to let you know, <br>
I have installed drupal 9 in the same root directory and it works fine, also I've installed dolphin there too and that worked ok. Both worked on the first installation attempt.</p>
<p>I have just now hosed that root folder on my domain and reinstalled Drupal 9 by uploading the zip and <br>
extracting it via cPanel.</p>
<p>Opened my browser and typed in the domain name and the installation screen came up straight away.<br>
It went straight to the URL <a href="http://xxxx.com/core/install.php">http://xxxx.com/core/install.php</a>.</p>
<p>So the issue has to be with the files in Backdrop.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with shared hosting/cPanel, but sounds like maybe an <code>.htaccess</code> issue...?</p>

<p>As far as I understand it, the major difference between the two types of hosting is one share's resources <br>
with a number of users where the other has only one user.<br>
I have deleted the .htaccess file to see if that made a difference but it didn't.</p>

<p>Did you check your Apache logs to see if there were any error notices there?</p>

<p>@oadaeh (Jason Flatt)<br>
Thank you for your suggestion. <br>
I was able to resolve the issue by reading that webserver log. <br>
The solution is as follows ...</p>
<p>Error log stated<br>
"SoftException in Application.cpp:267: File "/home2/xxxx/public_html/xxxx/index.php" is writeable by group"</p>
<p>But when I looked at the permissions of index.php the group write option was not selected. <br>
The permission level was 644</p>
<p>So I selected all the permission options (The permission level was now 777) then saved the file. <br>
Re-ran the install again (Was just checking), it still had the same error, as expected. <br>
I then set the permission back to 644 but this time when I ran the install, it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>So clearly there was a problem with the webserver, for some reason <br>
it kept reading install.php was writable by group, even though it wasn't.<br>
So changing the permission to something else seemed to unlock its stuck state.<br>
I probably would have only needed to set the group write option save it then un-set it to release the web-server's stuck read state.</p>
<p>Thank you for all contributing, it's greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
