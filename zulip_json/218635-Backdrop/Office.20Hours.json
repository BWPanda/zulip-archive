On checking, it seems this was a source of contention between D7 Token and Entity Token maintainers. So now a new user of my port (maybe the first user) has complained about the token browser links not working. I've discovered this is because the browser has two copies of all field tokens, one with a name made of underscores, one with dashes, but  both would have an ID made of dashes. This is the same in D7 but it caused no proble there, but messes up the JS in Backdrops Treetable implementation</p>",
