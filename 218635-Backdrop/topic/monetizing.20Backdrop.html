<p>OK, I see your point. I also find the idea interesting, especially compared to the paid plugin model, which creates reverse incentives, I agree with Ryan. BTW Matt has left Centarro a few days ago, I really like him and his contributions to Drupal and Open Source, he is an important voice for me in this discussion.</p>

<p>It's a proposition from Matt Glaman, how to fund Drupal Commerce (he's a maintainer) in a more sustainable way, especially maintaining modules (even more than creating them, abandoned modules are a big issue in DC). Basically you pay for getting the latest release. I do not propose this for Backdrop, I just shared the link because Ryan adressed a current WP problem with their current payment model (developers don't care about interoperability), which Backdrop (and Drupal) have not.</p>

<p>Instead of gated releases, backdrop could look first into providing some additional services for a price. Sort of how Jetpack works in WordPress. Such as providing a backup service.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that the best road to sustainability and growth for Backdrop is to monetize the system. Finding the balance between hobby sites / very small businesses and businesses willing to pay is the tough part.</p>
<p>I love the "free" part of Drupal, but I do not love the stagnant, always living in dev part of Drupal.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> noted</p>
<p>Monetization brings pain, but it also brings growth in areas that wouldn't normally grow.</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily advocating for it. It's simply an observation of many free, open source projects and watching the ones that monetize, flourish and the ones that don't, either have a very nasty culture or become overshadowed or irrelevant.</p>
<p>I just noticed your comment about core and I would be fine with BD keeping monetization out of core and core contribs "unless" a "Pay for newest" subscription model was implemented where those paying get the latest major release first and the free version gets one version behind. What is classified as major can be up for debate. Another option is enterprises vs free which seems to be a popular model.</p>
<p>My case for monetization is less about core and more about creating contrib projects where people can continue to make money on a project they've worked on. Drupal has proven it's model is bad for the community with it's countless number of "dead" projects with countless issues in the queue and no word from the author to fix them.</p>
<p>Backdrop can simply make some money on the back end of this to help support the furthering of core.</p>
<p>I may have said this already, but a non-profit that isn't making a profit, is closed. That's a quote by someone way smarter than me, but they're right. Non-profits have costs and overhead and donations or grants can only go so far.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, core folks need to afford food on the table and so does the community at large.</p>

<p>...one of the things that has greatly upset me in Drupal-land is that the DA announced on behalf of the entire Drupal community that "the community will not be providing support for D7" ...so they have basically made that decision on our behalf, without allowing those of the community that did want to provide support to do so, and then on top of that they shamelessly went on and started offering a paid plan for LTS support, part of the profit from which will also pay for their salary ...lets just say that I find it totally unfair for people like that to be taking advantage of all the work that many many others before them have put into a project, without any fee. Are these guys smarter for swooping in and wanting to make a profit off of the free software that others have helped build and off of the community from which they are excluding members? ...no, they aren't smarter, they are just opportunists (not for lack of other words for it, just my manners won't allow me to speak it out loud <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> )</p>

<p>There are other opportunities to make money with Open Source. We shouldn't go the WP route. Selling services/work/expertise is fine and works for me, selling code feels totally wrong.</p>
<p>This part of the B philosophy is very appealing to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freedom: Remain Free and Open Source. Open Source has the ability to change the world for the better. All code included with Backdrop is under an Open Source license that allows anyone to use it free of charge, ...</p>

<p>I should note that I'm active in other communities that promote the Free Software philosophy.</p>

<p>There's no difference between charging a client $1500 for the "code" vs charging 100 people $15 for the "code".  Look at it as charging for the service of time invested to create a product.</p>

<p>That wasn't by intention. It just seems that there's good consensus on the Backdrop philosophy, and your proposed direction is too far outside of it.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, you will find a YouTube or twitch star that talks about the donations they receive. A buddy I personally know got $3000 from one guy because my buddy mentioned needing a new computer for his steaming channel.</p>

<p>I think the way it can fit the conservancy is by showing a message at the payment collection screen something like: "Payment for this module is a donation (tip) to the author and not a sale of goods." I would word it better than that with more time but that's the idea.</p>

<p>Another thought... I think this can work for core, but modules and themes usually get installed via the UI inside an install. I don't think it's possible to include a payment button there.</p>
<p>A more prominent &lt;strike&gt;donation&lt;/strike&gt; "Pay what you want" button next to the download link on b-org should be feasible, though.</p>

<p>Personally, I do. Better start a new issue, which has a different focus anyway, than revive one, that clearly had disagreement - on something else.<br>
But we should refer to those two issues and point out clearly, that the new one tries to achieve something different.</p>

<p>Yeah, the pattern I'm seeing around monetization is a hard no. I would like to at least see discussion on what it could look like.</p>
<p>It honestly scares me when a core member threatens to leave without at least exploring options or at the very least, explaining why they are passionate about opposing an issue.</p>

<p>I feel that we should be asking for enough donations to keep our servers/domain running. Other than that, we shouldn't need much.</p>

<p>...and say we at some point need paid services by somebody, then managing donation $$ could become questionable. Who is responsible for selecting the provider? ...will that be done in a transparent way, or will people thing that some are getting "kick-backs"?</p>

<p>@klonos I'm not advocating for gated releases per se, but I don't think it breaks the philosophy of free and open source. The code would still be freely available on github. But I think there are other ways to help make BD financially sustainable. Such as with an equivalent to Jetpack - add-on services for example</p>

<p>One other example: CiviCRM offers paid long term support releases for those who can't upgrade to the latest releases but still need security updates. I'm not sure how that would look for Backdrop but it's another model that fits within free and open source</p>

<p>It's my (personal) understanding that we prefer to use backdrop/backdrop-issues for code related issues only AND that we use backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org for anything related to the codebase for <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a>, policy issues, or community issues. </p>

<p>My concern right now is that we have too many different places for discussions for people to keep up with. Before we add any new places to discuss, we need a better way to map them out so that people can find the right place.</p>
