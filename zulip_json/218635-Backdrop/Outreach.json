Thank you!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"268468\">@Vladimir</span> <br>\nI don't do much in the way of custom coding, other than themes - which are ALL custom child themes of basic or corporate KISS. Those are very heavily customized per client.  I may port modules as I need or take an existing module and customize to meet a use case, but I do that sparingly.  I don't have the time with over 100 clients, and my client base will pay for custom theming but not coding as a rule (they can't see it, they don't want to pay for it.)<br>\nThe few cases of custom coding I have needed on Backdrop so far are:<br>\n1) Adding IMCE to link dialog (still working on this one and when it's ready will submit for contrib)<br>\n2) Adding buttons to ckeditor for editing such as indent and outdent (this is now a contrib module - not mine)<br>\n3) Adding IMCE file editor to image field (this is a forthcoming need for the catalog client )</p>\n<p>Use Cases (just a few examples)<br>\n1) NSFW -  adult toy shop <a href=\"https://sensualwhipsandtoys.com\">https://sensualwhipsandtoys.com</a>.  This site really made use of ubercart attributes. This would have been an absolute nightmare to set up and for the client to maintain in Commerce.  I had a client years ago on Commerce (Custom t-shirt shop) that had to shut down their site because the time required to keep the site updated was too much for them.  Ubercart couldn't handle their requirements at the time.</p>\n<p>2) Catholic high school - eCommerce is used for event ticketing, transcript fees, and so on. <a href=\"https://mhsmi.org\">https://mhsmi.org</a>. (We have more that will have to be migrated eventually as well, but pretty much the same functions.)<br>\n3) Office Furniture Site - this is a catalog site that has their inventory online but not does not purchase online (the product costs too much to ship).  It's an eCommerce site with no payment, but webform blocks with every item, so that will be a bit of custom.  <br>\n4) Parts manufacturer - this will be a custom eCommerce solution using Ubercart.  The custom portion will be filter view blocks on side that allow narrowing of product choices (think Amazon or Best Buy).  I scoped it out years ago for them in D7 and am now expecting that I will need to do it in Backdrop, but the scoping I did should work for D7 as well.    I may have to port Better Exposed Filters for this, but who knows by the time they're ready to spend the money to move.<br>\n5) I have 4 eCommerce clients on CubeCart / Open Cart that I don't' think will ever move.  I'd love to get them on Backdrop, but I don't think it will ever happen, due to the expense.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>",

Perhaps a brochure site with a blog, maybe using an extra module to two, to show the whole process for those new to Backdrop and new to site creation. This would be valuable for new users and those wanting to move from Wordpress or other CMS to Backdrop.</p>\n<p>The problem with documentation that I see so far, is that you know what features and methods Backdrop has, but not why or where or when to use them. For new users, it would be helpful to see how sites are built from start to finish. One method is to find an new user who does not know Drupal or Backdrop and lead them through the process. Much will be learned that way.</p>",

I felt like the general consensus pointed to the folks who are currently on Drupal 7. I want to formally say: Make them the target audience for the next 2.5 years.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of Drupal 7 folks out there who have heard of Backdrop, (like me) but haven't had the time or interest to check it out for fear it would be too much work to migrate, or figure out how to replace XYZ module functionality. There's also a lot of Drupal 7 folks who aren't even aware of Backdrop CMS.</p>\n<p>What I think might help, is to create and focus on a marketing campaign that pushes over the next 2 years (D7 EoL is now 11/2022) that is designed to convince people to \"upgrade\" their Drupal 7 site to the new and improved, secure, future ready, wait for it... Backdrop CMS!</p>\n<p>The very first step: Create a module for Drupal 7 called: BackdropCMS Ready Check which is similar to <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status\">https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status</a> and get it posted out on the actual <a href=\"http://Drupal.org\">Drupal.org</a> site.
