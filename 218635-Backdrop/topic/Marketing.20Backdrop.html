<p>I looked through all the Zulip topics for anything that seemed relevant to the outreach meetings or marketing, but I didn't see anything.  So I'm creating a new channel, "Marketing Backdrop".  Let's see how this goes :)</p>

<p>There's also this.  (I'm not agreeing with the sentiment of the headline, just interested in the issues that it brings up)</p>

Other "content management systems" (a.k.a. CMS's) have long claimed that "Drupal is hard", "Drupal is expensive".Is Drupal hard? Is Drupal 8 even "harder"? Is it "too expensive" for your non-profit?Does Drupal suck at non-profits?In this article, I take a deep dive, looking at what non-profits need from a website and how well Drupal can provide for those needs.Read on to see what I think, and PLEASE, share your thoughts in the comments below!Note: we posted a follow-up with an idea for a solution to this problem at Drupal 8 has left small non-profits behind... How can we fix that?</div></div></div>

<p>I've read both of these articles back in 2017 <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256664">@Luke McCormick</span> ...and there were quite a few comments mentioning Backdrop. We seem to not have included these articles in our <a href="https://backdropcms.org/news/mentions" title="https://backdropcms.org/news/mentions">https://backdropcms.org/news/mentions</a> page (because Backdrop is only mentioned in the comments I guess - not in the main article) ...but should we?</p>

<p>If it's just mentioned in the comments I don't think we should include it</p>
