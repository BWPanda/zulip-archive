I know that there's <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/bigmenu\" title=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/bigmenu\">https://www.drupal.org/project/bigmenu</a> but at some point, I think that there was a contrib module that would allow you to insert entire menus as menu items into a \"master menu\"; the result was that each \"submenu\" was managed separately, and the \"master\" menu had less items to deal with. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the name of that contrib, and I am not able to locate it. Perhaps others have either better memory or better google-fu than myself.</p>",
