I personally loved the work that was put into Drupal panels before responsive became a thing which relinquished all of my panel layouts to single columns but I still use the crap out of mini-panels and custom content-panes.  I know the custom content panes can be replaced with blocks (which I despise to this day because they were horribly designed) but I'm not sure how to go about replacing the mini-panes and more specifically, I'm not sure how to replace the pane rules that accompany panes.  Context might be an alternative but when I used it on D7, I found it to be rather buggy and very lop-sided with functionality.</p>\n<p>So, in order for me to consider moving to Backdrop long term, I would love to see some sort of replacement for the pane rules and hoped someone way smarter than me might be able to come up with a way to replicate that functionality or offer some suggestions on alternatives.</p>",

Also, maybe look at porting the context module (this may take a lot of work)?  Display suite and context were not in core in D7 either.  For the above, how about using a view with a rewrite results  on the price field?  I've done something similar before.  I like the idea of a feature request to add fields to visibility conditions, but I think that might have to be contrib, rather than core  because it would probably depend on something like token filter.  I use token filter a lot.  I also use the URL path to filter items as well (ex. only show if 'instock' or hide if 'outofstock').  That does require adding the variable you're filtering on to the URL.</p>",
