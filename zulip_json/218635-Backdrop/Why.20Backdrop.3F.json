If customers prefer WP (if they're already familiar with it), then there's probably not much you can do to convince them. And you shouldn't, because you'll hear frustrating sentences like \"but in WP I had this and that feature out of the box...\" - whether it's true or not.</p>\n<p>On the other hand a web CMS is only a tool. If it's much easier for you to implement whatever the project needs with Backdrop, then describe them what and why. Describe why the project will be set up faster and at lower costs. (Money is usually a good argument for most customers.)</p>\n<p>In other words: it depends on the project and its needs. I don't think there could be generally valid explanation why Backdrop is the better choice - although I'm personally convinced that it is. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
