So I deleted that release and also deleted the faulty tag, created the correct tag, released again - no package and no project page on <a href=\"http://b.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://b.org\">b.org</a>. Is there anything I can do to fix this?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: never mind - deleting/creating once again fixed the problem</p>",
