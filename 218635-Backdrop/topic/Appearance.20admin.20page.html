<p>I would like us to fix a few things in the admin page used for managing themes. Here's a list of issues (most of them have PRs that need review btw):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4410">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4410</a> (adds a checkbox to the Appearance page)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4459">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4459</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4439">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4439</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4461">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4461</a><br>
...the thing is that all of them are touching on the same files, so I would like us to decide on order these should be worked on and merged if possible.<br>
...eventually, I would like us to move to a UI that looks like what I proposed in <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/131#issuecomment-441398733">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/131#issuecomment-441398733</a></li>
</ul>
