And any late comers like myself will quickly start recognizing them thanks to their active participation in community discussions on github, zulipchat, forums or regular video-meetings. Especially it's easy to recognize those PMC members who use their real names everywhere. I had to search on Andy Shillingford to find out he is, in fact, <code>docwilmot</code> - that username I recognize.</p>\n<p>Now, the only person in PMC whom I could not find in any kind of discussions is Jack Aponte. And I wonder how Jack relates to Backdrop and Backdrop community. I've missed lot's of things, especially from times when Backdrop was just taking off. So probably Jack played some role back then. Could someone please enlighten me about Jack's place and role in Bakcdrop community?</p>",

The PMC should reflect all perspectives from within the Backdrop community ... The PMC should also aim to be inclusive of people with different levels of technical experience, geographies, languages spoken, races, and genders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To your question about how to know PMC members place and role, I think it would be good to list the perspective/constituency they are bringing to the role. The leadership page lists \"core developers, back-end developers, front-end developers, site-builders, people familiar with the business of website development, people focused on user-experience, and others as identified by the community\" as a starting point. Personally I'd love to make sure that nonprofits and educational groups were represented, which I happen to know is part of what Jack brings.</p>\n<p>(Also you may not be aware if you haven't happened across the announcement but Jack has been on personal sabbatical until recently which has rightly meant their name has shown up less often here.)</p>",

I think the community needs to know each PMC member well and recognize who are they, how they are tied to the project and what are their contributions, which are measured not necessarily by number of commits to core.

That sort of mentality is what drove people away from Drupal. Documentation is equally important, and promoting the project too - code is not top priority in Backdrop. See <a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/philosophy\">https://backdropcms.org/philosophy</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Backdrop values the needs of the editor and architect over the needs of the developer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I stay corrected: of course, only code without anything else won't do. I understand importance of every aspect of managing the project. However, if you'd like to put someone from Arabic countries in PMC just because s/he from there, you will push potential code contributors away. We are not here to create some kind of social project that cares about under-represented groups, we are here to contribute code to eventually create one of the most successful CMS. Caring about under-represented groups is really noble thing to do, however I really hope the project leaders won't be distracted too far from what our focus should really be.</p>",

To my understanding diversity in PMC is beneficial, if not required. Let's not underestimate the danger of \"information bubbles\". Only listening to people with the same background will - at some point - lead to wrong decisions, based on wrong assumptions.</p>\n<p>I never thought about the process of nominating someone to the PMC. Mainly because I know, that it can be hard to find people, who dedicate themselves to a project for a longer time and sacrifice (potentially) lots of their spare time. My approach with communities (I'm member of other ones) is: If they're willing to <em>do</em> something, don't hold them back.</p>\n<p>I do not feel like the existence of the PMC reduces (or neglects) the importance of code in any way. The product \"Backdrop CMS\" is code, but code alone without a strong and lively community behind it, wouldn't be sustainable either.

We're doing our best, I think, but we can and should do better and I appreciate the questions and discussion. </p>\n<p>2) It is important to for folks who are not aware, that part of the reason that they don't know much about the PMC is that the PMC has not been that active of late. For the most part our community is making decisions for code and community during public meetings and in the issue queue. As a community, I think we are very transparent in our decision making. The lack of information about what the PMC is doing is largely the result of the PMC not doing much. </p>\n<p>This is not necessarily a good thing. It is something worth talking about. </p>\n<p>3) I feel pretty strongly that Backdrop is more than just a software product. We are also very much a community and our work should reflect the values of our community. That's my opinion and I think it is shared by most of the folks who are very active in the community. See: <a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/philosophy\">https://backdropcms.org/philosophy</a></p>\n<p>4)  I agree that there may be a more active role that the community can play in shaping the PMC. However, I don't think that voting for members of the PMC is the right solution. It may through nominating members or it may be through periodic public discussions about the work and makeup of the PMC. This is an interesting discussion to have.</p>",

However, unlike <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"330989\">@Phil Ward</span>, I don't see this as being a necessarily good thing... For example, when an idea is proposed in the issue queue, and there's lots of positive feedback from various community members, but then Nate or Jen give their feedback which might be in opposition to the majority, I feel like their opinions seem to carry more weight than others, and ideas have been shut down in the past because of that. Now those past examples may well have been not-so-good ideas after all, but my point is that when someone is seen as an 'archetype', their opinion shouldn't  necessarily matter more (carry more weight) than others, especially when they're in the minority...</p>",

The \"weight\" or \"loudness\" of a voice within a community can be difficult to handle - for the person speaking, as well as for the person listening. The bigger the weight, the more cautious a statement must be to not \"roll over\" other people's opinions. That can be challenging.</p>\n<p>However, I don't feel like that's a real problem in the Backdrop community.

I came across a problem and came up with a fix but didn't know how to contribute it.  I joined here, reached out, and was welcomed by helpful and rapid assistance on a Friday night (UK time).  I often found on Drupal a kind of condescending air against anyone who didn't know how to spin up docker/vagrant/puppet/ansible etc but not here; I find the community being welcome and supportive to less expert members.  I've watched a couple of meeting videos and the thing that strikes me is the respectfulness of discussion.  Diversity is good, not for its own sake, but for the ability to make decisions that will benefit a wide audience.  I'd like to see the ethos preserved and don't feel there's a need to have wider elections; I feel that when people are competing to be elected, you lose some of the mutual respect.</p>",

I've got a lot of thoughts on it all. Will try to write it up. I don't think that making the PMC an elected body is good at this point for all the reasons others have stated. I'm part of a community center (that is viewed as an anarchist organization) and our Board is not voted on by the entirety of the collectives in the org. Diversity is a key reason, it also keeps board issues from becoming larger political fights, allows the board to focus on the important work that no one else wants to do so the others can do their thing. it works well. <br>\nand on the specific of Jack, their presence on the PMC speaks very loudly to the community of non profit dev folks that I exist in. It was a clear message that Backdrop intended to make rhetoric of inclusion a fact; that there is more to value in a community than git commits. <br>\nmore later. <br>\nnice to be back and see things moving along nicely.</p>",

So in an effort to promote <em>more</em> diversity in the PMC, what do people think of setting a maximum time for PMC members to serve? My reasoning for this suggestion is that without this, the same group of PMC members (or the same core subset of PMC members) will just continue to serve year after year. If we were, however, to set a maximum service time for PMC members, then as old ones rotate out, new ones can be brought in. I believe this will keep the PMC 'fresh' and diverse; getting ideas, leadership and insight from a wider range of people over time, rather than the same each year.</p>",
