In it, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project node could not be created on <a href=\"http://BackdropCMS.org\">BackdropCMS.org</a> because no .info file was found in the repository.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there a way to avoid this? I don't need an info file, because this isn't a module/theme/layout, and I don't want to give the impression that it can be installed like other projects by adding an info file. But at the same time I don't like the 'packaging error' text file added to the release... FYI, Drush has this same problem.</p>",
