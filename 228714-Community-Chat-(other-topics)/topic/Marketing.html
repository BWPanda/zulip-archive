<p>I just checked my website stats... interesting to see that "drupal alternative" made appear my site on Google nearly 400 times during the last 12 months. (OK, position is 20, so no clicks,). But I never did any SEO for this keywords. I will further investigate, but these people were really searching for an alternative to something they know (and they consider to abandon, knowing that this might be a huge undertaking). This is the kind of keywords/search intention I like when doing SEO and SEA for customers:-) <a href="/user_uploads/18319/y-s--O6ZGuUGzN7Mz9nTX2wY/Screenshot-2020-04-05-at-12.51.28.png" title="Screenshot-2020-04-05-at-12.51.28.png">Screenshot-2020-04-05-at-12.51.28.png</a></p>
