I've mentioned using Googles Workspace for Non-Profit for the internal backdrop email which would also allow it to be used as an SMTP relay. It's not my decision, so all I can do is recommend. I don't know what costs are involved with sendgrid, but the free Google Workspace for Non-Profit might reduce some costs in the short term until more advanced features are needed.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/deny-lists/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://sendgrid.com/brand/sg-twilio/SG_Twilio_Lockup_Social.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/deny-lists/\" title=\"What do I do if I'm added to a deny list?\">What do I do if I'm added to a deny list?</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">What do I do if I'm added to a deny list?</div></div></div>",
