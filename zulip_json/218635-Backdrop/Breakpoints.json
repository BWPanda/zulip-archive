Maybe re-work how breakpoints work from a UX standpoint? I love its purpose, but never use it because of its design. I always felt it was too cumbersome to setup and maintain. The UX just didn't jive with me. I felt like it should be simple to use, but couldn't fully wrap my head around how to use it. With the advancements of Flex and Grid, I kind of feel like breakpoints should be relegated specifically to images as opposed to themes or layouts though I do know there might still be a place for those. All I ever really wanted from breakpoints was to use it for image file size control based on viewport. (specifically smaller file sizes on mobile)</p>\n<p>What I would suggest, is move the breakpoints to the image styles themselves instead of using it global for the site.</p>\n<p>Totally hijacked this topic, so we can start a new one if you're interested in collaborating more.</p>",

Or in the menu (ie. at what breakpoint it turns into a mobile menu). So I think long term, having a central breakpoints configuration apart from image styles directly is still important. Otherwise you have to keep setting the same breakpoints in a bunch of different places.</p>",

The themes (mainly bootstrap) I've used over the years generally just handle menu sizing.</p>\n<p>Either way, I think the functionality is warranted but the execution could be a lot better.</p>",
