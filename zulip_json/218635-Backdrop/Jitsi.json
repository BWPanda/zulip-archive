However, I spent a lot of time figuring out our Google Hangouts system, then figuring out our Zoom system. Right now, I think our Zoom system is working pretty good and I'm reluctant to invest my own time testing another system during regular meetings, unless we're pretty confident in the alternative or unless we have a very specific need. </p>\n<p>My experience with online meeting software is that there are lots of unexpected places for the process to go wrong and I'm not eager to make a change unless it's for a good reason. I just have other things I would prefer to invest my time in.</p>\n<p>If anyone else wants to schedule a meeting and figure out all the details of recording (if necessary/desired), then I am happy to join the call and help test it. But, I don't really want to have to figure out a new video conference, streaming, and recording to YouTube solution right now if I'm hosting a meeting and reponsible for making these things happen. We just got the existing system to work properly. :-)</p>\n<p>That's just where I'm at. In a few weeks or months, I might feel differently.</p>",

I'd love ideas and others to collaborate if interested. So far the basic implementation allows you to create a field of the \"Jitsi Meet\" type, and then it embeds a video conference through Jitsi Meet on that page (or term, or user profile... etc.) There are some settings that would make sense to expose on a module basis, as well as on a per-instance basis as future improvements.</p>",
