My suggestion was that webp was pushed as the default image with a fallback to the more stable formats. Needless to say, it never went anywhere. Now that D9 is out, there's talk about them implementing it in some form though I believe it's just to add it as a recognized format, not to add any sort of fallback.</p>\n<p>The two reasons I believe webp never took off:<br>\n1) Internet Explorer<br>\n2) Nobody wanted to implement a push first fallback else method for the browsers that didn't support it at the time.</p>\n<p>Had the big web players (wordpress etc) done this from the beginning, I personally believe webp would have become the default image format years ago. Firefox wouldn't have waited until 2019 to add it and Safari is still yet to add it. Chrome currently holds around a 60% market share which is going to grow to about 85%-90% with Edge now being built off Chromium and FF having a rather sad and painful death.</p>\n<p>I'll digress ;-)</p>\n<p>Oh, not trying to suggest anything persay, just throwing out some thoughts on the matter.</p>",

If it weren't for safari not properly supporting webp, I wouldn't worry about it as much but considering the range of browsers out there, having two versions available to send to those that support it and those that don't will ensure cross compatibility for quite some time. Maybe this has been discussed and I'm unaware. I would be fine honestly if this was contrib. At some point in the future it shouldn't be necessary to cater to supporting vs non-supporting (in theory) and it would leave the site maintainer to determine if they neef backwards compatibility in the meantime.</p>",
