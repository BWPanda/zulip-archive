The instructions, from what I've read, assume you already know how to create a database...  They haven't been written with the novice in mind.  For example, where it says \"Create a database and make a note of the database name and <em>hostname</em> (usually localhost).\"  \"The database name and localhost\" bit shouldn't really be in the same sentence and it does seem to imply you will get the settings from phpMyAdmin or similar.  A good proportion of shared hosting will use \"localhost\" and if you are using it on LAMP or WAMP or MAMP then it will also probably be \"Localhost\" but some hosting providers do use a separate system for hosting the database server... for example the hosting company I use, you have to specify the server similar to this... \"<a href=\"http://shareddb1a.hosting.stackcp.net\">shareddb1a.hosting.stackcp.net</a>\".</p>\n<p>So, should the instructions be expanded (I don't mind helping) or should the instructions be changed to point to places on the internet where instructions have already been created for the different systems?</p>\n<p>And, where a certain level of knowledge is expected, that should be stated... for example, \"The following instructions will assume you already know how to create a database with the correct privileges to be able to install BackdropCMS\"  type of thing.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>",

        "content": "<p>@klonos - MAMP is pretty specific to Windows and is a bit wicky (odd) to work with.  It absolutely does not work the same as the Linux/ Unix,  (just like everything else on Windows in my personal opinion). They make a macOS version for some ungodly reason too, but I've never touched that, Linux/UNIX works fine and MySQL server can be installed on a mac as is.  The Linux/Unix version is standard and that's what Drupal was developed on.  I think the original installation instructions from Drupal (and that Backdrop is also based on) were written in German for Linux systems and then translated.  They also do presume some basic Unix / Database knowledge, as well as some basic programming skills.  I only go as far back as D5 and we really only started focusing on Drupal as an agency when 6 came out.  We only had a few D5 sites.  It was easier for my partner to do static at that point.  D6 was really a turning point for us.  The basic installation really hasn't changed.  I don't know what it was like before that.  Wordpress also installs pretty much the same way.  My conclusion is that it's really the MAMP portion that is different and probably very poorly documented because it's such a small user base.  ( <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/\">https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/</a> ). I've installed MySQL server and Drupal locally with no problems, without MAMP, FYI, when I needed to test something out.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://www.mamp.info/images/icons/mamp-pro.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/\" title=\"MAMP &amp; MAMP PRO - your local web development solution for PHP and WordPress development\">MAMP &amp; MAMP PRO - your local web development solution for PHP and WordPress development</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">MAMP GmbH is the manufacturer of the award-winning MAMP software.</div></div></div>",
