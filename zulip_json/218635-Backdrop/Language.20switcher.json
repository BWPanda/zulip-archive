Has anyone else noticed that the language switcher doesn't display the language name in the native language? It does that in D7 where it's \"Français\" but in Backdrop it says \"French\". Need an option to translate the name as well. But it can't be with locale since we actually want it translated on the <em>English</em> side and on the French side it should say \"English\". Clear as mud?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/18319/iddPD5q3Tu_aPFTKTUC5SBHS/Screenshot-from-2020-10-26-22-08-17.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2020-10-26-22-08-17.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/18319/iddPD5q3Tu_aPFTKTUC5SBHS/Screenshot-from-2020-10-26-22-08-17.png\"></a></div>",
