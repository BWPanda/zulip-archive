So for now I want to just remove color support for the sub-theme, so that it doesn't show the settings coming from <em>Basis</em>. Does anyone know how to do it?</p>",

Reading the color module's code makes me think that it's impossible. The base theme's settings are always merged regardless of what the sub theme sets or unsets. At best one can produce php notices...</p>",
