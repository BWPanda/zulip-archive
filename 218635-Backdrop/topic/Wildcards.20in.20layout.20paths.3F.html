<p>Has the topic of supporting wildcards in layout paths ever come up? Not % placeholders; true wildcards, so that, for example, a layout with path <code>foo*</code> would be used for both <code>/foospam</code> and <code>/fooeggs</code>. Particularly if implemented along with <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3749">issue 3749, Make layouts aware of path aliases</a>, this seems like it would be really useful. One could create a layout with path <code>*</code>, then  use visibility conditions in "Menu settings" to apply it to all sorts of diverse paths selectively.</p>

<p>This module worked for a time, but I think it's abandoned and needs some TLC to get it working again:<br>

<p>I worked on that: <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/pull/3134/">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/pull/3134/</a> but I hit a difficulty that I dont recall and put it down for a while. Something catch-22-ish that I couldnt get around; dont recall what it was. Also didnt really like the approach in that PR.</p>
