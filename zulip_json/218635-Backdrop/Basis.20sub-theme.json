Reading that article (and the original from the api site, it seems that it should be loading all the css in the components folder of basis theme and it's not doing that (on Safari or Chrome on  a mac, even after I flush the caches).   (see original article and this article  number 12) - the base css in the css folder is loading, just nothing in the components folder.   my sub-theme has only 1 css file (page_style.css) which should not override any of the original basis files, so that I can be careful what I use. colors subdirectory is copied over.<br>\nInfo file is:  <br>\n\"type = theme<br>\nname = XXX Basis<br>\ndescription = XXX Basis Custom Sub-Theme for XXX Environmental.<br>\nbackdrop = 1.x<br>\nbase_theme = basis</p>\n<p>; Add theme CSS files<br>\nstylesheets[all][] = css/page_style.css<br>\nstylesheets[all][] = css/colors.css</p>\n<p>; We need at least one setting for the theme settings page to appear in the<br>\n; menu.
