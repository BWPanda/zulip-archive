NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER is deprecated and the default SQL mode includes NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER. Assignments to sql_mode that change the NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER mode state produce a warning, except assignments that set sql_mode to DEFAULT. Expect NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER to be be removed in a future release of MySQL, and its effect to be enabled at all times (and for GRANT not to create accounts any longer).\"</p>\n<p>Which was addressed here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4238\">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4238</a></p>\n<p>But: I discovered it when I I found I wasn't able to create new Backdrop sites in Backdrop 1.17.1, which was released Sept 30.
