(My vote) This information has a date limit on it and as people move away from D7, the need for this info becomes less and less to the point of shutting it down.</p>\n<p>For right now, let's figure out if we pool it all together or treat this as a completely separate project.

It's double work to a degree, but basically all of the backend chatter can stay on git and the frontend discussion can stay on <a href=\"http://d.org\">d.org</a>. That way we can test it a bit before anything gets pushed to <a href=\"http://d.org\">d.org</a> and we can keep general chatter such as support requests over there as well.
