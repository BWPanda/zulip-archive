I think one of the reasons is that previously it would start a job to build a preview site, then wait 3 seconds and check if the job was complete, otherwise repeat. Now however, Tugboat provides a 'Retry-After' header which specifies how long you should wait before trying again. It's currently (or was when I was doing all this a few months ago) set to 10 seconds. I asked the Tugboat guys about this and while they admitted it was a long time to wait (for something that should be fairly quick), they also said that ignoring this 'retry-after' time would technically be hacking their API and advised against it. So that's why it takes longer. Solutions would be to hack their API and ignore this time (just continually check the job status every 2-3 seconds (instead of 10), or ask <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"258586\">@quicksketch</span> to talk to them and see if it's possible they reduce that 10 second wait time...</p>",
