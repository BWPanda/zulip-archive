He quickly changed the concept for the weekend towards a takeaway service. I took my laptop, and we quickly setup a landing page, a newsletter and a social media post to inform people that the restaurant is open Sunday (= yesterday). The response was overwhelming, a lot of people sent congrats to the restaurant owner, for his good idea (the venue is pretty popular over the weekends, great view to the Alps).</p>\n<p>And guess what? Backdrop really made a difference for me. Sure, Drupal 8 or any other CMS can also setup a text-only page within a few minutes. But I was able to change also the layout and a few other details very quickly, right at the restaurant table. The customer was pretty impressed (the old CMS was Contao, quite popular here, and quite complicated). </p>\n<p>Today, I will continue to build my SMB platform on Backdrop, where config management plays an important role. There will be more customers which need a helping hand in the weeks to come, and Backdrop’s *flexibility” will be the base for the solution. </p>\n<p>So <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256570\">@StPaulTim</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256607\">@BWPanda (Peter)</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256729\">@klonos</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256757\">@docwilmot</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"263951\">@jenlampton</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"258586\">@Nate Lampton</span> and everyone that  I forgot to mention...
