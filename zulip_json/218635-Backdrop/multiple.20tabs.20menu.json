I cannot create a custom menu and assign a menu_name to each menu item, and render the menu block as tabs, because the menu items don't appear in the block. I guess the only way to do this is by creating a custom block which prints the links list without depending on the menu.inc. Any other ideas? Thanks.</p>",
