Can you imagine if I had to shop for clothes like that?  I go shopping for clothes, and I walk into a room with racks and racks of white T-shirts.  The clerk tells me I can do anything I want!  Cut them to any shape, dye them any color or pattern, emboss them with any ornaments or buttons I want.  But I don't know how to competently do any of that!  I just want to be able to point to a shirt and say \"that one looks nice\" and buy it.</p>\n<p>That's what I think we should offer for themes.  Give people some choices that they can point to and say \"that one\" without forcing it to be any more complicated than that.</p>",
