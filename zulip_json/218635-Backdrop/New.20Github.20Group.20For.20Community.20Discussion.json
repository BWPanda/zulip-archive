Not a great option IMO because links will have to be moved, site documentation fixed etc which just creates additional overhead for someone later. \"less work now for more work later.\"</p>\n<p>Speaking of overhead as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256570\">@StPaulTim</span> mentioned, I can see where having yet another area of discussion when other areas are trying to be consolidated is a possible problem, however, looking at how the <a href=\"http://backdropcms.org\">backdropcms.org</a> website mentions the different github pages and repositories, it's no wonder why the different places for discussion are so confusing to understand.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256607\">@BWPanda</span> The reason I don't like the idea of a single \"community\" repo is because it takes too much time to weed through the cruft of issues that have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The core issue queue is a great example where ideas are muddled in with bug fixes. Sure they all result in code change but trying to weed through and find one or the other? Not fun.</p>\n<p>The other reason is because many of the specific repos I mentioned in my previous thread, need their own .md files to house any policies or hardline discussion that are formed through the topics discussion from within issues inside that repos queue. We need a way to formalize the discussion and put it into a formal document for many of those discussions. I don't like the idea of having a different .md file for each and every major discussion topic inside one repo, especially when some of the topics may need 2 or more document files to outline the policies and guidelines.</p>\n<p>Will a single repo to house all discussion work? Yes. It's just not ideal for organizing thoughts and discussion.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I wasn't sure about labels being global or defined per repo so doing some research I found out labels are defined per repo. That said, I am still not fine with a single \"community\" repo but at least we can create labels for each of the different areas of discussion. It will work in the short and interim, but It's going to be a very poor organizational structure for the long term. The problem with labels? They only work when they are used properly.</p>\n<p>If you're going to do it anyway because \"manpower\" then let's not call it \"community\" but rather \"community-discussion\". At least make the repo name descriptive to what it's used for.</p>",

We can have labels for all the things you mentioned in your earlier comment, such as <code>type - outreach</code>, <code>type - policy</code>, <code>type - infrastructure</code> etc. and that will in fact allow us to be able to add multiple labels in an issue. Then we can have <code>needs - feedback</code>, <code>needs - vote</code>, <code>needs - documentation</code>, <code>needs - usage metrics</code>, <code>needs - pmc decision</code> etc. labels ...and also labels such as <code>status - postponed</code>, <code>status - rejected</code>, <code>status - duplicate</code> etc.</p>",
