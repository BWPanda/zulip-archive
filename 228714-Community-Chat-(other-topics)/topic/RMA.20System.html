<p>Just wondered if anybody has implemented a RMA (return goods) type system (or similar) in Backdrop? We looking for a system for clients to log a return/repair which they post to us, and we update them via email. Eventually I'd like to get our support tickets on the same system.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307683">@Kevin Golding</span> I need to do the same at some point. I was just going to create a webform for someone to fill out so maybe that would be a good solution temporarily.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> That seems like a good starting point, but I do want it to be more than just a form, so I'm trying to decide whether to custom code it in my languages of choice (golang/vuejs) or have a go using backdrop - I suppose I'm just not familiar enough with backdrop to know if it's a reasonable fit.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307683">@Kevin Golding</span> I can't help with the coding side of things but I guess my question is whether you are already using a backdrop site for other items (ecommerce) that would make sense to tie the RMA to a product that already lives on Backdrop.</p>
<p>I'll say that "yes" it can totally be done in Backdrop it's just a matter of whether you would want to code for it. The main benefit to using Backdrop is the field/database structure that Backdrop can provide.</p>
<p>If you think you'll use the site for more than just RMA then yes it's worth it. If you only plan to use the site for RMA then a more straight forward solution might be the better route.</p>
