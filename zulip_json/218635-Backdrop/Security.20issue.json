I'd have to dig it up, but essentially, the temp directory can be a place for malicious or even benign code to be uploaded and then used as a file sharing service. The issue never went anywhere because Cron \"usually\" clears out the temp directory after a decent amount of time (usually 8hrs or less), but as a test, I was able to witness a file living in the <a href=\"http://d.org\">d.org</a> temp file area for somewhere around 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>All somebody has to do is write a bot to reupload the file and it becomes a place to house files that shouldn't be there.</p>\n<p>To reproduce, upload a file on a node, copy the url to the file then exit the node without saving it. Most file fields on most sites aren't a big deal for malicious code, but <a href=\"http://d.org\">d.org</a> allows quite a few file types. Image fields for example could be used to serve porn or illegal images.</p>\n<p>So, not sure if this was ever mitigated in BD. I haven't thought about it until this extension exploit came out.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/23/cve-2020-13671/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/09095150/drupal.jpg)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/23/cve-2020-13671/\" title=\"Drupal-based sites open to attack via double extension files (CVE-2020-13671) - Help Net Security\">Drupal-based sites open to attack via double extension files (CVE-2020-13671) - Help Net Security</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Admins of Drupal-based sites should plug a critical security hole (CVE-2020-13671) that may be exploited to take over vulnerable sites.</div></div></div>",
