<p>I added some comments to: <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3750">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3750</a></p>
<p>Eager to see if they are helpful (or if I even understand what is going on). I think I do have a pretty firm grip on what this PR is trying to do now, but we'll find out shortly if that is true. :-)</p>

<p>I have created <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4496">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4496</a> and have collected every useful comment I could find where people tried to explain what contexts are and how they work. Please review these explanations and let me know what needs tweaking. Hoping to simplify this as much as possible for people that are finding it hard to understand the concept.</p>
