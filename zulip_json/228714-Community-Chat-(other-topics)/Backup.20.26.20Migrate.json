I've personally used Backup and Migrate for years but never used the \"migrate\" part so have no idea if it works well. Backdrop is a bit special in that you'll need to make sure to backup everything (code, db and files) so as to catch the config files wherever they may be. Maybe it works, not sure.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate/issues\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7720679?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate/issues\" title=\"backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate\">backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Port of the Drupal backup_migrate module to Backdrop - backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate</div></div></div>",
