<p>Initial creation of the topic for Backdrop Upgrade Status.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> let's use this to do some collaboration on this topic.</p>
<p>I'm curious what your thoughts are on tying the telemetry from this module in with the Backdrop telemetry initiative vs creating a small, crude but focused collection site to retrieve and output the collected data?</p>
<p>One thought is to add the telemetry into BUS (Backdrop Upgrade Status) and start sending it "somewhere", and later incorporate it into the overall initiative collection site later.</p>
<p>Another thought is to leave it all housed on the crude site and sandbox this from the initiative. (My vote) This information has a date limit on it and as people move away from D7, the need for this info becomes less and less to the point of shutting it down.</p>
<p>For right now, let's figure out if we pool it all together or treat this as a completely separate project. This decision will help determine how involved you need to be.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> you seem to be interested in this as well so your thoughts are more than welcome.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256757">@docwilmot</span> I don't think you were able to listen to the discussion about adding telemetry to BUS, but it was decided that we a) don't need a separate Backdrop endpoint site and b) we don't need to house the data on <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a></p>
<p>There are two suggestions floating about where to store the data 1) standalone sql database 2) a Google sheet</p>
<p>We basically just need a standalone script that can "listen" for the incoming data and send it to the database.</p>
<p>Have any thoughts so far?</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256607">@BWPanda</span> </p>
<p>That said, I think git would still be good to use internally for tracking the actual coding issues and dealing with backend discussion (since it's familiar to the BD community). It's double work to a degree, but basically all of the backend chatter can stay on git and the frontend discussion can stay on <a href="http://d.org">d.org</a>. That way we can test it a bit before anything gets pushed to <a href="http://d.org">d.org</a> and we can keep general chatter such as support requests over there as well. It's an idea.</p>
<p>I've created an issue this evening for BUS that seems to be pretty nasty. The title is mis-leading and needs renamed since I only got those errors at the beginning of my testing but since I'm not sure what the actual problem is, (only how to replicate it) I don't know what to title it. Curious if anyone else is running into the same thing.</p>
