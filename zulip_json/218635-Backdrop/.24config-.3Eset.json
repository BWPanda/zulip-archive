It does say it is to <em>be</em> deprecated so I thought there was no point in leaving it in, I may as well try (TRY being the operative word) to do it the BD way <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>\n<p>Already have the $form['#config'] in...  I thought this was to add the settings to the form, how would I then save the settings?  I'm using the $config-&gt;set()...  but while it saves a text field ok, it's not saving an array value...  checkbox option... it puts the array item key and not it's value <span aria-label=\"frown\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f641\" role=\"img\" title=\"frown\">:frown:</span></p>",
