I've been known to make it myself. Recently, I've raised these questions to a very different issue. </p>\n<p>1) What is the problem we are trying to solve?<br>\n2) Is this the best solution?</p>\n<p>In this case, the problem is very real. In planning any event, especially a virtual event, I think that the problem of engaging the audience and keeping them interested is one of the most important problems to think about. I believe that the success of almost any event is largely influenced by how engaged the audience was and how well we did at keeping their attention. People are not likely to learn a lot and/or change their behaviors based upon participation in an event, if they were not engaged and focused.</p>\n<p>As the advocate for and author of the Mural Board, there has never been any doubt or lack of clarity in my mind, about what problem I am trying to solve.Whether or not this is the right tool or the best tool to solve the problem could be debated. I happen to think that a Mural Board has the potential to increase engagement among some users (hopefully a lot of users) and am looking for creative ways to use this tool to solve this problem, hence my question  which might have been better phrased, \"How can we best use this tool to solve the problem of stimulating maximum engagement during Backdrop LIVE?\" At the same time, I know that no one tool, technique, or format is going to work for all users. </p>\n<p>Another legitimate question would be - \"Is this the right tool and/or <br>\nwhat other ideas or tools might work better or in coordination with a Mural board?\"</p>\n<p>I'd love feedback on either. </p>\n<p>(Sorry for long response, but this is a topic I think about a lot and enjoy discussing, so I appreciated your question.)</p>",

I tried to set up the Mural Board with built in instructions and the best UI that I could with the tools provided. But, I totally get that it might not be clear. I can think about ways of making it's purpose and how to use it clearer OR accept that it might not be the right tool for this task.</p>",

In fact, it's easy to recover deleted items. But, it's not so easy to revert edited items (not as easy as I thought).
