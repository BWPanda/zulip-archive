If/when users are registered they can set their own time zone, but before then, has anybody heard of a way to allow a \"change the time zone\" selection on the conference schedule page itself?</p>",

But, my \"hacky\" solution to your time zone problem, was to automatically translate the session time into a hand full of common time zones and publish them on each node. I have some custom code that does the calculations for each session. At this point, we're not asking people to login yet, so they are not yet able to take advantage of Backdrops handling of time zones. </p>\n<p>I'm looking for a better solution, but this seems like it's one step in the right direction.<br>\n<a href=\"https://backdrop-live.backdropcms.org/session/welcome-introduction\">https://backdrop-live.backdropcms.org/session/welcome-introduction</a></p>",
