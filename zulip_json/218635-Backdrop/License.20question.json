The theme is inspired by your wonderful Editorial template (<a href=\"http://html5up.net/editorial\">html5up.net/editorial</a>). While I haven't used any of Editorial's HTML or JavaScript code, the Backdrop Editorial theme looks quite similar to the Editorial template when you install it in Backdrop.</p>\n<p>I haven't made an official release yet but you can have a look at the theme at <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/editorial\">https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/editorial</a>.</p>\n<p>I've read that the HTML5 UP templates are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license which doesn't seem to be compatible with Backdrop's GNU General Public License. I'm not sure if the CC Attribution license applies in my case, as I didn't use the HTML5 UP code. And I've however mentioned Editorial and HMTL5 UP as inspiration at the top of the README.</p>\n<p>Are you fine when I make an official theme release in these circumstances, or are you rather opposed to the idea? If the latter, I'll also remove the theme from the Backdrop contrib Github repository, but I hope there is a way to keep this nice theme somehow available.</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nOlaf</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/editorial\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7720679?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/editorial\" title=\"backdrop-contrib/editorial\">backdrop-contrib/editorial</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A magazine-like Backdrop theme.
