Because of this, refreshing the master preview no longer works since it tries to install Backdrop over itself. This isn't a problem, except that it was set to automatically refresh every day (to keep the codebase up-to-date). I've disabled the auto-refreshing, but had to rebuild the master preview since it was broken. Because of that, all other previews got 'disconnected' from the master one, which meant suddenly they were taking up ~1GB each (instead of ~100MB). I re-built the master preview, and now it's going through all other previews rebuilding them. So the space problem will be fixed soon (if not already).</p>",
