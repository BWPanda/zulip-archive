Just use @media with the breakpoint you want and then hide the dropdown menu (display:none) and unhide the menu-toggle.  ex: <br>\n@media screen and (max-width: 48em) {  <br>\n     #main-menu { display:none; }<br>\n     #menu-toggle-button {display:block;}<br>\n}<br>\nThe exact syntax and breakpoints depend on your particular theme and use case.  I find I prefer to go to the menu toggle at the biggest point it makes sense.</p>",
