<p>No wonder Google maps is so popular... I was just looking at a website that uses Bing maps, and I zoomed in on where I used to live in Estonia. I lived across the road from a supermarket, which was there when I arrived in March 2018. On Bing maps that supermarket is nowhere to be seen - it's just a forest! Don't know where/how Bing maps gets their aerial photographs, but they're very out-of-date, especially when compared with Google's.</p>

<p>I have also noticed that some mapping systems do not allow you to zoom in as close as Google does, and/or the clarity is not as good at the zoomed in levels. I would love to use some other mapping system (especially OpenStreetMap), but no others are as complete and/or usable.</p>
