<p>This is going to be a long shot, but does anyone have experience integrating <a href="http://Tugboat.qa" target="_blank" title="http://Tugboat.qa">Tugboat.qa</a> with Backdrop? I'm trying to get the <a href="http://B.org" target="_blank" title="http://B.org">B.org</a> custom module <code>borg_tugboat</code> working on my site using my own Tugboat account and repo, but I'm getting an error that doesn't happen on <a href="http://B.org" target="_blank" title="http://B.org">B.org</a>... It's a matter of some urgency, so if anyone can assist I'd be very grateful!</p>

<p>I haven't tried at all but curious. Wasn't there a port from Backdrop to d7 of a tugboat QA module?</p>

<p>So I originally took the <a href="http://B.org" target="_blank" title="http://B.org">B.org</a> module and started refactoring it to make it more generic and release it as a contrib project anyone can use. Then I ran into this issue, and thought maybe I'd messed something up. So then I tried using the <a href="http://B.org" target="_blank" title="http://B.org">B.org</a> module as-is, but had the same problem (so it seems to be something else (my site, Tugboat account, etc.). While looking into this I found the Drupal module. Apparently someone had a similar idea a while ago and started porting the <a href="http://B.org" target="_blank" title="http://B.org">B.org</a> module to Drupal. From the looks of it they basically just tried to get it working in Drupal, not refactor it like I was doing. But not much has happened there (I think I got further than they did).</p>

<p>I've now rewritten parts of the module to use Tugboat's new API, which is much easier and actually works for me! So all good now <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>
