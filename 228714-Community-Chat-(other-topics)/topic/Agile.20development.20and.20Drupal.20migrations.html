<p>I've been thinking for some time about how Drupal upgrades/migrations push organizations and agencies into un-agile development. I am currently working on a large site migration to Drupal 8 and trying to do it in releasable chunks. But Drupal makes it really hard. It forces a wholesale upgrade, a relatively fixed amount of work, when when the organization is happy enough with their site. I was reading up on migrations and came across this line on Drupalize docs: "This is a great opportunity to give your website a face lift." So they're basically saying, if you're going to have to spent an unknown amount of money on a fixed scope of work, might as well do even more work for more money."</p>

<p>This is the opposite of agile.</p>

<p>Instead we want to make it possible to break the work into smaller chunks where we can release each separately to the public so we can get real world feedback.</p>

<p>But that's really hard to do when you're forced to upgrade everything at once.</p>

<p>In the case of our one client, we're going to have two sites up and running at the same time. All the Drupal 7 functionality that was deeply connected with CiviCRM will stay on the Drupal 7 site until next year. And everything else will go to Drupal 8.</p>

<p>The best case scenario is that the staff and end users will not see much difference in how they use the site. That's a funny way to spend tens of thousands of dollars in the hope of seeing not much change in functionality.</p>

<p>Sure, it'll be more secure and it means they'll get more benefits in the future with new releases. But most of their interaction is with CiviCRM which will be the same.</p>
