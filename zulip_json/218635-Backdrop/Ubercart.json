(I do need to look into it though)</p>\n<p>That module deals with the attribute/option core UC module. It will allow different images per option. What I managed to do was create a completely different node page load based on the drop-down.</p>\n<p>Options are confined to the respective node whereas my variations change the physical node itself.</p>\n<p>Having variations on individual pages allows for \"each product is a line item\" which solves two problems: 1) Better SEO 2) Better identification for accounting software that requires every product to be a product.</p>\n<p>Having each product as its own line item for accounting purposes is precisely why Commerce went the route of \"every product is a product\" and they did away with options/attributes. It's the \"standard\" way of doing e-commerce however not every store needs this and it is way more complicated to maintain and setup than the UC attribute system.</p>\n<p>I personally like using attributes as a way to test a product. I can setup one page with attributes and test to see if I get any traction. If no, I don't waste a bunch of time. If yes, that tells me it's worth breaking each product out into its own node variant.</p>\n<p>The one problem with commerce OOTB is that they didn't create a \"bundled line item\". This means it isn't possible to have multiple line items housed within a single line item. There was somebody working on a contrib for this around the time I stopped focusing on commerce so I don't know it's status. Bundling line items would allow a store to offer \"made to order\" products where you customize a product based on individual components. </p>\n<p>Imagine wanting to sell a computer. You can sell each component separately so they need to be their own line item, but if you add those to a custom built computer, that computer needs a line item that houses the components. The way commerce is designed, the store owner has no idea if the components go inside the computer or if they are being purchased as individual components.</p>\n<p>Hehe went on a bit of a side tangent.</p>",
