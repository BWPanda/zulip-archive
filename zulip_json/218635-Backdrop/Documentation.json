And the views documentation is kind of incomplete (mostly because the Drupal 7 documentation was pretty scanty on views - like how to do some of the more advanced stuff like filters and relationships etc.). I don't think there's really anything else.  Also layouts could really be expanded. It's an enormous improvement on D7, but there's not a lot of information on how to really take advantage of it in the documentation (LOTS in the chats when you ask, but what about people who don't ever get here?
