Having used Backup and Migrate this morning to migrate the said site from a staging server to a production server it seems to be quite involved (I followed <a href=\"https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/deploying-backup-migrate\">https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/deploying-backup-migrate</a>).</p>",

For example, if no custom or contrib modules have been used, you basically only need the <code>/files</code> directory (which includes the configuration and media assets) instead of the entire codebase. You can then instruct users to download and install the same version of Backdrop from scratch (instead of copying the entire codebase).</li>\n</ul>",

So unless you've deviated from the defaults, you only need the codebase and the database.</p>",

I was trying to work out why you have to export the configuration files and import them rather than just copy them as part of the file system. Looking in the <code>settings.php</code> it appears the configuration folder name is derived from a hash of the database connection string, and thus will change when moving to a new server.</p>",

The config directory names are defined in settings.php. Whatever you set there will work. You can change that, but it won't get overridden if it's already set. Make sure that the config directory ships with your export.</p>",
