Part of that is for having lots of real life use cases from 20 years of being in business.   I was going to tackle this next week. What I wanted to do is mirror the Ckeditor file browser setup (in configuration) from Drupal 7 - we already have IMCE installed and i think the code is there in the D7 module to hook it in from there.  It seemed the easiest way to tackle it and will be flexible.  I.e default NONE, but IMCE is in list if installed.  AKA:  (i.e. the code could be stolen (hopefully) from drupal 7 ckeditor project and then ported to Backdrop ?)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/18319/uuxEV-RaBNA7e6d_VVbyY6Oj/ckeditor-file-browser-settings.jpeg\">ckeditor-file-browser-settings.jpeg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/18319/uuxEV-RaBNA7e6d_VVbyY6Oj/ckeditor-file-browser-settings.jpeg\" title=\"ckeditor-file-browser-settings.jpeg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/18319/uuxEV-RaBNA7e6d_VVbyY6Oj/ckeditor-file-browser-settings.jpeg\"></a></div>",

She didn't really want anything, but we will do a slight size increase in the next few weeks.<br>\n2) PC or mac - on my computer it goes all the way across (on a 4k screen). and what browser?  Not a worry for us - most of the users are mobile.  But I'm curious.  There's no margin on left at all for me on slideshow.  Right margin doesn't show up until 3200+ pixels and that's there for scrollbars on mobile. <a href=\"user_uploads/18319/UxgdSu7V5b0hdILgFnJ4cnT8/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/18319/UxgdSu7V5b0hdILgFnJ4cnT8/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/18319/UxgdSu7V5b0hdILgFnJ4cnT8/image.png\"></a></div>",

It does sound like the ultrawide curving may be throwing things off.  Mine is a 4k 35\" or 37\" but it's flat screen.  I don't typically use my laptop monitor unless I'm on the road. My computer is docked most of the time. The laptop is a Retina 15 inch too, but I don't develop on it.  Too small.  That monitor sounds like it would be great for gaming or video editing.</p>",
