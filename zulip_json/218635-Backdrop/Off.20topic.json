COVID-19 has hit our clients and our families hard, and we regret to announce that we're closing up shop at the end of the month.\n\nHook 42 has been driven by our core values since we started in 2012: honesty, quality, community, ongoing improvement, work/life balance, and humor. We've loved being part of the open source community, in particular, the Drupal community all these years. We will always have fond memories of working with an amazing team, great clients, and wonderful community members.</div></div></div>",
