As a Drupal project maintainer, I am supposed to keep up to date separate documentation for each project in three areas: the README.txt file, the main project page, and that contrib documentation section. And even if they all had the same content, you still have to keep up on the three separate areas, and the formatting for at least two of them is different. For someone who does not have a lot of time for responding to and fixing issues, maintaining three separate sets of documentation is a little too much.</p>",
