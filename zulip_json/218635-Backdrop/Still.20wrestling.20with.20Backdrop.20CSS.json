Stymied because if I inspect the page and pick out existing classes, it sometimes works (and sometimes also styles parts of other pages I <em>didn't</em> intend, because flexible rows reuse class names?). But if I try to assign my own classes and style those, it's a hodgepodge of sometimes-yes, sometimes-no.</p>\n<p>For example: I can name a persistent block with a class contact-block, and if I style that background I can get the color I want, but it doesn't style the margins. So I take that out and put a custom class into the row declaration in the layout template—and that doesn't work. I'm inspecting all of this in Chrome and Safari, and copy-pasting the selector tree out of the browser and into the CSS sheets, rebuilding cache each time, and whether my declarations show up appears to be entirely random. It <em>seemed</em> to work when I used l-colmd4 or some such that was generated by the layout template—but then that's also the name of the sidebar column elsewhere, and applying any kind of additional selectors took away the styling entirely in both places.</p>\n<p>Note: I'm brushing up on my CSS in my off-hours, so I could be missing something simple, but I assumed using the selector from the bottom of the class tree would always work?</p>",
