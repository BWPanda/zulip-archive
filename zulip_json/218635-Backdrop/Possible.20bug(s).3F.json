Bugs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you may select an existing image, but there is no option in the \"Insert image\" dialog to upload a new image <span aria-label=\"thumbs down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" role=\"img\" title=\"thumbs down\">:thumbs_down:</span> </li>\n<li>existing images can be added to the description of terms, and they can be viewed, so they are saved properly, but the usage count for the image file does not get incremented. This means that if the \"main\" image gets deleted from everywhere else it is being used, eventually its usage count will reach 0, despite the fact that it is being used in one or more term descriptions ...eventually, garbage collection will kick in, and it will delete the actual file, which will result in data loss <span aria-label=\"thumbs down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" role=\"img\" title=\"thumbs down\">:thumbs_down:</span> <span aria-label=\"thumbs down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" role=\"img\" title=\"thumbs down\">:thumbs_down:</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is there any existing issue for this that I couldn't find?</p>",
