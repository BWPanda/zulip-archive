<p>This former Backdrop user is spamming the issues. Examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3174" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3174">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3174</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2432" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2432">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2432</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think we should be deleting their posts and sending them a message that they are free to comment in the Forum if they want to complain. The issue, in my mind, isn't that they're complaining about Backdrop but that they're posting the same message multiple times on totally unrelated issues.</p>

<p>It was 7 posts in 7 separate issues, each copied and pasted (exactly the same wording). To me, if its exactly the same wording, and if its unrelated to the issue in question, its spam.</p>

<p>Interesting; in my Android app (Octodroid) I can view the user's profile and there's a 'Public activity' tab that shows their comments across various issues (so I can scroll down and count the comments they've made that have the same wording). But I can't see anything like this on GitHub itself...</p>

<p>Hiding such comments (instead of deleting them) seems less brute. Might do that next time.</p>
