<p>I would like us to eventually agree upon and then start enforcing/implementing things like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/604342">https://www.drupal.org/node/604342</a> and gradually do it for all our UI elements (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/user-interface-standards">https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/user-interface-standards</a>)</p>

<p>I like the idea, but... Writing all that together, or maybe even finding agreement on all these topics might take a lot of time. And I'd prefer "recommending" over "enforcing". But we could just use the Drupal docs if we're in doubt, how things are done properly. Not as a strict set of rules, but as a welcome guideline. That still might be a matter of time - or the lack of it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not enforcing things leads to inconsistencies. Like people adding periods to the end of checkbox labels, or using Title Case For Everything. ...but yeah, I was thinking that we should copy these docs verbatim (which is what we've done initially with our coding standards), since our Drupal brethren have a larger community, with more UX/UI experts. We could then discuss individual standards if they need to be changed/tweaked for Backdrop.</p>
