With each new release, the project drifts slightly away from Drupal, yet so much of Backdrop will remain familiar to Drupal 7 users and developers. In this session we'll talk about the things that make Backdrop unique and different as well as how it compares to Drupal 8/9. In particular we'll look at some of the major innovations in Drupal 8/9 compare to Backdrop CMS, things like Layouts and Configuration Management. We'll also talk about how the Backdrop CMS community and decision making process compares to the Drupal project. </div></div></div>",
