While that looks much better, it unfortunately has the apparent effect of not loading the JS needed for certain form items (such as the vertical tabs). Looking into a fix for that now...</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/featherlight\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7720679?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/featherlight\" title=\"backdrop-contrib/featherlight\">backdrop-contrib/featherlight</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A very lightweight jQuery lightbox plugin.
