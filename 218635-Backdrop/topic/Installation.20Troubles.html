<p>An experienced Drupal 7 developer told me they had some difficulty installing Backdrop locally for the first time (in the past). I asked for more details and they tried again today and reported. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, for 30minutes I attempted to install BD using both the Installation Instructions and Advanced (drush) instructions. Must have been doing something wrong on each because couldn't get the db right. Switched to using the DDEV instructions and spun up a site in 2 minutes. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've asked for more details. They are going to try again and provide more information.</p>

<p>This user has experimented some more and has decided it was probably user error on their part. I've asked for ideas on improving documentation/instructions and am waiting for reply.</p>
