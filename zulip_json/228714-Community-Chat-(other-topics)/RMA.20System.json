The main benefit to using Backdrop is the field/database structure that Backdrop can provide.</p>\n<p>If you think you'll use the site for more than just RMA then yes it's worth it. If you only plan to use the site for RMA then a more straight forward solution might be the better route.</p>\n<p>Interesting: <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1044784\">https://www.drupal.org/node/1044784</a></p>\n<p>Possible ready-solutions:<br>\n<a href=\"https://servicecentral.com/solutions/rma-process/\">https://servicecentral.com/solutions/rma-process/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.readycloud.com/lp/rma-software-system\">https://www.readycloud.com/lp/rma-software-system</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://renewityglobal.com/returns-management-software-rma-portal/\">https://renewityglobal.com/returns-management-software-rma-portal/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://repair-online.com/\">https://repair-online.com/</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://renewityglobal.com/returns-management-software-rma-portal/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://noor.pixeldima.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/slack-imgs.jpg)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://renewityglobal.com/returns-management-software-rma-portal/\" title=\"Returns Management Software | RMA Software – Renewity Service Team Automation - Renewity - RMA &amp; Service Management\">Returns Management Software | RMA Software – Renewity Service Team Automation - Renewity - RMA &amp; Service Management</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Are your customers and distributors demanding a customer portal to request RMAs and to view their st</div></div></div>",
