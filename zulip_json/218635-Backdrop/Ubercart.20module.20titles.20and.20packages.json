Whereas over on <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/modules/ubercart/contributed-modules/ubercart-3-module-list\">the Drupal side</a>, most are just called \"Something\", and a few are called \"UC Something\". This makes me wonder:</p>\n<p>1) For modules created solely for Backdrop Ubercart (no D7 port), is there a preferred naming scheme?</p>\n<p>2) For modules ported from D7, should the name be exactly what it was in D7 (modulo capitalization standardization), or should it be adjusted to follow a preferred/consistent naming scheme (i.e., add or remove \"Ubercart\" or \"UC\" to/from the name)?</p>\n<p>Then there's the question of which package the contrib module should belong to.</p>\n<p>3) Should the package name for an Ubercart contrib module be one of the non-core Ubercart package names already defined by the Ubercart modules (i.e., \"Ubercart - extra\", \"Ubercart - fulfillment\", \"Ubercart - payment\"), or a specific separate name (e.g., \"Ubercart - contrib\"), or are there no particular recommendations?</p>\n<p>4) Whatever the answers to 1–3 are, would it be a good idea to document that information on the <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/ubercart/wiki\">Ubercart project Wiki page</a> (which I'd be happy to draft)?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/ubercart/wiki\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7720679?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/ubercart/wiki\" title=\"backdrop-contrib/ubercart\">backdrop-contrib/ubercart</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A flexible but easy-to-use e-commerce system for Backdrop. - backdrop-contrib/ubercart</div></div></div>",

If it hears that intent, it does something with it.</p>\n<p>As long as the endpoint can reach the internet (not blocked by an apache .htaccess password login for example) then anything can be configured as an endpoint.</p>\n<p>My terminology might be a little off but in essence, instead of sending a file with information like XML or json, you send a machine name (intent) to the listener. If the listener sees (hears) it, it checks authenticity through the token and routes it to the appropriate account based on the API key.</p>\n<p>It's a way to send real-time information over the wire without having to send a bunch of files every time something needs to be done.</p>\n<p>I want to say it can be asynchronous as well, but I'm fuzzy on that part.</p>",

There has to be a configuration setting on the Backdrop organization account to tell GH to ping a certain URL on BackdropCMS for the magic to happen. That URL isnt my laptop, so I cant test what happens when there is an official release. I can fake it by creating my own webhook, installing ngrok, making relaeses on my own GH account and see if it all blows up (I faked similar to get where it is at now), but in the end, we'd still need to test it on BackdropCMS. I'm hoping to hand the progress-so-far code to one of you to do more realistic testing because I've reached the end of my fakery skills.</p>",
