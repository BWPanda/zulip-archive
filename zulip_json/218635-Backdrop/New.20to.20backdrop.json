It's been on my radar for a couple years now and it's great to see that its still going strong.</p>\n<p>One hesitation I have is that coming from Drupal 7 there are thousands of modules available, so you can do a lot without writing any custom code. I see you have a lot of the major modules ported over, but I'm wondering what Backdrop site builders do when they realize a module they're used to in Drupal 7 is not available. Is porting a module from D7 to Backdrop a huge deal? If someone wants to invest the time in porting one over are they responsible for maintaining it and backporting security updates?</p>",

Neither of these modules are available in BD, so if I were to migrate I'd have to either port them or come up with some other way of doing that calculation and conditional display in the view.</p>",

You can actually just change a line or 2 in the .info file of the D7 module, and chances are that it might just work like that.
