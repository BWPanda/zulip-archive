That’s one of the reasons we don’t just upgrade.  We tend not to use drush or composer because we’re a small shop that’s been around a long time and does more than just Drupal, so I have my own scripts. I tried out drush a long time ago and it wasn’t worth the effort for us. If you want to use one of those, I would recommend composer over drush.  It’s less overhead in my experience.  I use primarily feeds and some custom coding to migrate data from D6 or D7 to Backdrop.  I don’t typically bring over anything but content.  I recreate the webforms manually, since there’s usually only one or two. The one migration where there were a lot, we revamped the forms anyway, so I would have had to redo them.</p>\n<p>We’re not using D8 or D9 at all.  It’s too expensive a footprint for any of our clients with no benefit.  Hope that helps!</p>\n<p>I’ve run into a couple of wrinkles with feeds, but have gotten lots of help on Zulip, so there haven’t ever been any showstoppers with that.  I’m pretty happy with it.</p>\n<p>Good luck with your upgrade!</p>\n<p>Warmest regards,</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Garbeil, MBA PMP<br>\nBrainwrap LLC<br>\n\"Being on the web doesn't have to make your head hurt.\"<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.brainwrap.com\">www.brainwrap.com</a><br>\n(810) 560-7181<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:egarbeil@brainwrap.com\">egarbeil@brainwrap.com</a></p>",
