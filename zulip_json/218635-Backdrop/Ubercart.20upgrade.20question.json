The easiest way to deal with it is to download ubercart manually and edit the info files, then upload it to your site and run the updates.  It works without any issues that way.  Ubercart has the same problem on Drupal 7 - it's not unique to Backdrop and the solution is NOT to hide the submodules, but to fix them, because you will have issues with Ubercart if you don't fix it.  Everything will look normal and not return errors, but stuff just won't work.  It doesn't take that long to remove anything but dashes.   I have about 10 ubercart sites, split between backdrop and D7 and we just do the same thing for both and have not had any issues.  There is supposedly a server fix you can do, but I looked at it and it opened up the server to security risks.</p>",
