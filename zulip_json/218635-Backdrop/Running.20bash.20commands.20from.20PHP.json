This causes issues with permissions/access. I'm specifically trying to download modules with <code>b</code> and also <code>git clone</code> a repo. The files are downloaded and assigned to the <code>www-data</code> owner, and the <code>git clone</code> doesn't work because it's not using my account/SSH key. I've read something about allowing the <code>www-data</code> user to <code>sudo</code> to me (without a password), and then only allowing specific commands, but I'm wondering if there are other solutions...?</p>",
