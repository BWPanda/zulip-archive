I had an issue with linking to any repo with a <code>.</code> in the name (e.g. <code>github.com/backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org</code>), so I sent an email to Zulip help. They just replied (apologising for the delay) and explained that <code>.</code> does indeed work in the Linkifier regex, I was just doing it wrong: I had <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]</code> which it took <code>_-.</code> to mean <code>any character between _ and .</code> which isn't valid, so I couldn't do it. Zulip support pointed out I should simply do <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]</code> instead which of course works. So I've updated the Linkifier regex and now you can link to any repo's issue/PR!</p>",
