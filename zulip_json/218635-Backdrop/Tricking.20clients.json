If you have some content that you don't want clients updating themselves (e.g. a block, views header/footer, etc.) but they insist on having access ('cause they're <em>that</em> sort of client), just build them a form with a single textarea field and pre-populate it with the actual content from the site. Then make it so that when they submit that form it sends you their changes in an email (so you can do the actual editing) and displays a message to them saying the content's been updated but it may take a while for the changes to be displayed! <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span> <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span></p>",
