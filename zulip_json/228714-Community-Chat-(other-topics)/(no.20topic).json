I also loved the possibility to add anything into the wrapper (not only CSS classes, but also DOM elements from my CSS framework). To be honest, there's no 100% replacement for those functions in Backdrop CMS at this time. So I had to learn basic templating to get advanced(!) functions included, e.g. a bottom slider with partner logos. I am not a developer, but  I would never go back to Display Suite, after learning how fast I can achieve things in code compared to the UI of Display Suite, especially when I need similar functions for a different content type.. But let me be clear... I am talking about advanced theming requirements, beyond adding just CSS classes to a field wrapper. (BTW, my preferred Display Suite functions in D7 did not even make it to DS version 8. DS in D8 was a quite frustrating experience). But with Field Wrapper module and some knowledge how to print variables in TPL files, you can do a lot in Backdrop CMS</p>",
