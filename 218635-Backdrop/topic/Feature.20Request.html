<p>You know, it would be really nice if we could have block descriptions or administrative titles, even for standard block.  It would be very handy to know what's in a particular section of a layout for a page.  HERO BLOCK or Custom Text, really doesn't tell me anything.  Services, Testimonials, Contact, Team, etc.  are a heck of a lot more useful, especially when they are all the same kind of block (example - HERO BLOCK).  GAH...</p>

<p>Yep, I have this same problem on every site I've converted so far.  It's annoying, and I don't want to make every block reusable, nor do I want every block custom.   Why can't we have an administrative title/description on every block?  I only have approximately 40 or more sites to either convert to backdrop or Wordpress.  Why should I have to edit a block on a layout to figure out what I put there?</p>

<p>I'm pretty flexible, but no way in h(&amp;(*&amp;&amp;&amp;^^^^% do I need to see the description for 'Hero Block' or 'Custom Block' a bazillion times in layouts.  It's useless.  I'd rather see an administrative title or description, or teaser of block body than that.</p>

<p>That's the title displayed on the frontend. We're wanting a 'label' that's only displayed in the admin/layouts UI.</p>

<p>e.g. you might want a hero block with just an image on your frontapge, so the 'Display title' has to be empty. But then there's no way of setting an admin label to be displayed in the layouts UI so you know <em>which</em> hero block that is (you might have several).</p>
