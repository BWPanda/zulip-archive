<p>We then talked about ways that Backdrop Core might help these site owners. I think that there was some consensus that (in that specific discussion) that if Backdrop Core should not try to take on too much of this work, but if there is some basic meta tag information that could could reliably provided, then maybe that should be provided by core and we should leave the advanced/custom stuff to contrib.</p>

<p>(From a comment by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> in <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4995#issuecomment-799192477">this thread</a>. Opening this here since it's a bit of a tangent from the specific issue topic in that thread)</p>
<p>Instead of duplicating effort that has already been made in a contrib module, a few other thoughts/possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we update the dashboard to highlight some of these contrib modules that many sites will need but may not know about?</li>
<li>Would it be better to focus on recipes and create a recipe that installs the contrib and preconfigures it with these default settings?</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically, recipes already exist, but they don't handle functionality like this. Also, as was discussed in the recipes session, that functionality would be outside the scope of what is considered a recipe. It is closer to Features type of functionality, which as I understand it, is not on the radar.</p>

<p>By the way, it is interesting to know about the target groups of those 70% of sites where such modules are not used. Maybe this is something illegal? Or just testing farms?</p>

<p>I doubt it's anything illegal. I think it comes down to the fact that people don't know those things help with site/page rankings, etc., and/or don't know they exist.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268468">@findlabnet(Vladimir)</span> - I think that you are underestimating how many people build their sites without thinking about things like metatags and/or site maps - or don't even know that they need these things. Based upon personal experience, I think that many small freelancers get busy and often forget or never get around to these things.</p>

<p>I prefer to drop a message here, as I'm not planning to further contribute to <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4995">the issue</a></p>
<p>Important things from my perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not complicate D7 migrations - people might have used contrib modules for meta tags and the migration path could get cumbersome if parts are in core and other parts aren't</li>
<li>Do not force module maintainers to fundamentally rewrite their code within 1.x (remember the Backdrop philosophy regarding contrib)</li>
<li>Do not assume that all sites need extra metatags (all those og:* and twitter:* tags might - worst case - be undesirable)</li>
<li>Do not assume what sorts of pages, layouts, views, content types, ... sites have - this vastly varies because of the flexibility of Backdrop</li>
<li>Do not add meta tags OOTB, that need extra configuration - bad/wrong meta tags can cause a regression (all of the proposed extra meta tags need proper configuration, btw)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that you try to make things easier, but you might actually make things worse. As meta tags aren't visible, site owners might have trouble to understand, what's going on.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256738">@indigoxela</span> I understand where you are coming from, but so far it seems to me that those in favor of some basic SEO OOTB have demonstrated that lack of SEO is an actual issue that hurts individual sites built on Backdrop, as well as Backdrop as a product. All I keep reading in your comments is "might" and "could" re making D7 -&gt; Backdrop upgrades complicated or anything causing a regression/breakage. Yes, I am aware that these things may happen, that's why I am proposing to implement any solution in a backwards-compatible way, and work with site owners and contrib maintainers towards ensuring that we don't break things. ...I would NEVER propose to include any SEO solution if I knew it would certainly break things, so I don't understand your pushback before you have actually seen any code implementation. I would expect that we draft something simple, and then review it and investigate if it actually breaks existing sites or interferes with contrib modules.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256738">@indigoxela</span> the list you dropped above resonates so much though for me as a site owner, site builder <em>and</em> dev. Thank you for it! I hear you on the v long discussions being exhausting though.</p>
