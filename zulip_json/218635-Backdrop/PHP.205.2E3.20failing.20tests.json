This affects drush,  composer and other PHP CLI stuff and isn't possible to change without upgrading the control panel.</p>\n<p>When Backdrop was forked 6 years ago, the ability to choose was just starting to roll out from control panels and hosting companies.

HostGator for example was stuck on cPanel v56 about 5 years ago, but they had their own in-house version of choosing PHP (which wasn't introduced to cPanel until around v70 I think).</p>\n<p>So one thought before raising this, points back to telemetry.
