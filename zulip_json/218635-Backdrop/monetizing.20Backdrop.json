It's simply an observation of many free, open source projects and watching the ones that monetize, flourish and the ones that don't, either have a very nasty culture or become overshadowed or irrelevant.</p>\n<p>I just noticed your comment about core and I would be fine with BD keeping monetization out of core and core contribs \"unless\" a \"Pay for newest\" subscription model was implemented where those paying get the latest major release first and the free version gets one version behind. What is classified as major can be up for debate. Another option is enterprises vs free which seems to be a popular model.</p>\n<p>My case for monetization is less about core and more about creating contrib projects where people can continue to make money on a project they've worked on. Drupal has proven it's model is bad for the community with it's countless number of \"dead\" projects with countless issues in the queue and no word from the author to fix them.</p>\n<p>Backdrop can simply make some money on the back end of this to help support the furthering of core.</p>\n<p>I may have said this already, but a non-profit that isn't making a profit, is closed. That's a quote by someone way smarter than me, but they're right. Non-profits have costs and overhead and donations or grants can only go so far.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, core folks need to afford food on the table and so does the community at large.</p>",
