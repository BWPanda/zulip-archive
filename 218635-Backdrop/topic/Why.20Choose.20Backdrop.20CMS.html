<p>I just watched this 30 min video (at 1.5 speed) about "Why would a new developer choose Django?"</p>
<p>I recommend it to anyone interested in promoting Backdrop, because it's really a high level talk about why users choose an open source CMS in general with very few Django specific comments. It's a well thought out presentation and could almost as easily be entitled "Why would a new developer choose Backdrop?"</p>
