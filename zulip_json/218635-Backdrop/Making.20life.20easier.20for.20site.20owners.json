All I keep reading in your comments is \"might\" and \"could\" re making D7 -&gt; Backdrop upgrades complicated or anything causing a regression/breakage. Yes, I am aware that these things may happen, that's why I am proposing to implement any solution in a backwards-compatible way, and work with site owners and contrib maintainers towards ensuring that we don't break things. ...I would NEVER propose to include any SEO solution if I knew it would certainly break things, so I don't understand your pushback before you have actually seen any code implementation.
