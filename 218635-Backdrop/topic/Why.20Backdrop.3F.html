<p>The potential client (lawyer) asks why Backdrop instead of Wordpress (which appears in most other proposals). Does anyone have any links for a detailed explanation?<br>
I think it would be useful to have such a chapter on <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268468">@Vladimir</span>  Competing with Wordpress isn't easy. If customers prefer WP (if they're already familiar with it), then there's probably not much you can do to convince them. And you shouldn't, because you'll hear frustrating sentences like "but in WP I had this and that feature out of the box..." - whether it's true or not.</p>
<p>On the other hand a web CMS is only a tool. If it's much easier for you to implement whatever the project needs with Backdrop, then describe them what and why. Describe why the project will be set up faster and at lower costs. (Money is usually a good argument for most customers.)</p>
<p>In other words: it depends on the project and its needs. I don't think there could be generally valid explanation why Backdrop is the better choice - although I'm personally convinced that it is. <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>It's also hard to provide a good alternative to the network effects that greatly benefit WordPress</p>

<p>Here's some interesting promos for Wordpress. We should have something similar or better for Backdrop.<br>
<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/why-wordpress-benefits-wordpress-websites/">https://www.godaddy.com/garage/why-wordpress-benefits-wordpress-websites/</a><br>
<a href="https://thriveagency.com/news/wordpress-benefits/">https://thriveagency.com/news/wordpress-benefits/</a><br>
<a href="https://www.marketing91.com/what-are-the-advantages-of-wordpress/">https://www.marketing91.com/what-are-the-advantages-of-wordpress/</a><br>
These promo points may also apply to Backdrop. What does Backdrop do better that could be featured in a Backdrop promo?<br>
These kinds of "Advantages" websites are looked at by folks deciding how to build their website. The corollary would be a "Disadvantages" website that exposes the disadvantages of a CMS. People should see both the pros and cons in order to make an informed choice.</p>
