<p>Does anyone know what controls the hero image block background resizing in responsive?  It seems to crop rather than scale, and I'm trying to figure out where and how to change that?  I'd like it just to scale down, without cropping.</p>

<p>I figured it out, but will need to discuss options with the client now.  I will need to add some css, but it's not going to work with the current aspect ratio we're using.  (1633 x 300)</p>
