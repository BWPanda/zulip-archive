The Drupal site I'm migrating uses the Shortcode module so we could insert blocks anywhere inside body fields.  I was struggling with how to do that in Backdrop.  Using paragraph types, including a block reference, works great.  Probably better, no more searching for the shortcode.  <a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/project/blockreference\">https://backdropcms.org/project/blockreference</a></p>",
