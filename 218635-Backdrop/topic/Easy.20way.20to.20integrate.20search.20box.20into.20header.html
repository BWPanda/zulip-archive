<p>I haven't found a good way to add the search box to the header. On a lot of sites a search box ends up in the top right corner. Yet it's a bit difficult to put it there. Wondering if anyone else has good approaches for this. I was also wondering if we added it as an option to the default header block</p>

<p>I was able to add the 'Search form' block to the header on a test site just now, no problems... Are you having an issue doing this, or is the problem more a theming one in terms of styling it to appear literally in the top-right corner of the header? (in which case I'd suggest looking into CSS Flex/Grid/Floats)</p>

<p>More about design. I've used flex but it's not really user friendly</p>

<p>Wondering about a quick solution, much like how the header block already has smart defaults</p>

<p>Some themes/layouts would be better suited to this task than others then I imagine...</p>

<p>There was another person having issues with getting the Search block to display nicely relatively recently. It was on Gitter but I think related to how the submit button was displaying. Agreed that making this more friendly ootb would be helpful.</p>

<p>I think that was me. Seems like there should be an easy way in the UI to make the search button go next to the search box. I have to use Custom Search because I need several search paths.</p>

<p>I would like there to be a discussion about the Header layout in Basic. I think we need more flexibility to add things and produce different styles/layouts of header. I usually find I have to make custom alterations.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256705">@Herb</span> maybe we should add a checkbox in the header settings to include a search box?</p>

<p>That's what I was thinking. I took a look to see how hard. Probably not that bad to implement but I ended up moving on to something else. I can't recall if we have a backlog issue for it</p>
