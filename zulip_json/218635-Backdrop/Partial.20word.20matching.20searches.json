In the first tutorial, we created a custom search page using just Views and a Search API index. In the second, we looked at faceted search using the Facet API module.  Search API can be tough to setup especially for new users to Drupal. For example, you need to understand the difference between a Search API Server and Index, and then you need to spend time configuring everything.  In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create a search page using just Views and Drupal's core Search module.</div></div></div>",
