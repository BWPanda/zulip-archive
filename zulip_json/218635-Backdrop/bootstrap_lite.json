        "content": "<p>Hi.  I'm wondering about getting involved in this module.  I'm a big fan of bootstrap, both from basic HTML sites and from experimenting with Drupal8 (before finally giving up due to the complexities of Composer).  I note there is a fix to <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/19\">https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/19</a> and I have added a suggested fix to <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/6\">https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/6</a> but I don't seem to be able to do a pull request.  While I don't know how to necessarily fix all the issues, it would be good to get the fixes we have into a release, but I wouldn't have the first clue how to do that.  I'm a novice at git, but used it a bit, and completely brand new to Backdrop but have built Drupal 7 sites for many years.  Hopefully with a bit of guidance I can help to get this project moving forward.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/19\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7720679?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite/issues/19\" title=\"Update API URL · Issue #19 · backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite\">Update API URL · Issue #19 · backdrop-contrib/bootstrap_lite</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">The Bootswatch page is basically empty, because the API URL it's trying to call is old and doesn't work anymore.
