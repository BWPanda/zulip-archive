<blockquote>
<p>...a communication initiative for the Drupal community. It consists of a series of de-escalation templates we have dubbed “Nudges”.<br>
The team has written five nudges that community members can use when they are faced with one of these uncomfortable situations in the Drupal community. We selected topics that we feel can have the most impact and are easy to understand. Each “nudge” provides context as to why the comment may be harmful and relevant links including our Code of Conduct and Values and Principles.</p>
