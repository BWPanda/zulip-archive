Think of replying to someone in Zulip like replying to them in Gitter. Your reply will still appear at the end of the list and will not really have any connection to the post you're replying to (other than maybe the @username tag), but Zulip has the added ability to hide all other posts in the channel not related to that topic, so makes it a bit easier to follow a related conversation.</p>",
