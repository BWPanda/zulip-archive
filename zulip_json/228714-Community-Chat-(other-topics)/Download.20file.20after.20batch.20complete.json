I wants to run some intensive code to create a large zip file that downloads automatically after the zip is created (by calling <code>readfile()</code> then <code>exit()</code>) but this seems not doable in a batch API finish callback because the <code>exit()</code> hangs the batch process and progress indicator just keeps going forever. Is there any other way you can think of to get a file download after a batch process?</p>",
