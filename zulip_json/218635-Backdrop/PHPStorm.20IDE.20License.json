There is not a single token that anyone can use for a license, instead we send a registraton-link to individual email addresses and those people create jetbrains accounts, and the license is granted to the account. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256729\">@klonos</span> I think there is a jetbrains log-in in 1Password, but if not I'll add it there today.
