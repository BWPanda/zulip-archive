Drucker \n\n\nWhether you love it, hate it, or feel nothing about it. Whether you use it every day, or only sporadically, it’s become part of your work environment. Whatever your relationship to it is, you must surely feel something as it approaches the end of its life and you need to decide what to do about it. It’s your Drupal 7 site and it sunsets next year.</div></div></div>",
