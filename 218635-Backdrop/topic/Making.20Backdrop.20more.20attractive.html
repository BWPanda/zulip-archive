<p>My number-1 answer: make things more discoverable from within the UI. I learned several things during Tim's Layout session that I never would have discovered on my own .</p>

<p>That's something that even people who are non-experts in development could contribute via PRs; you don't have to know the intricacies of how layouts do their thing, you just need to know useful bits that people might want to know (and how to put it into a tooltip and file a PR).</p>

<p>I did have a D5 site upgrade cross my path in the last year, but I think they moved on because their previous site builder did not think Backdrop would be good for them, based on their needs. But I think D9 is majorly overkill for their site, and will be way more expensive then they really can afford to pay.</p>

<p>So there's a case of someone in the know recommending a solution that is inappropriate, possibly because of perception, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>The basic idea being, when someone is exploring the UI and encounters an unfamiliar term for the first time ('like "flexible layout template"), there's something right there they can click on to learn more, rather than having to go leave the site and start Google-searching or paging through the docs to find it.</p>

<p>My number-2 answer is (which I am making contributions to) is get Coder Upgrade working more completely, and then emphasize it in all docs talking about migration. From personal experience, it was a HUGE help in porting D7 modules (even with the current bugs).</p>

<p>People may not realize how close Backdrop is to D7 (Layouts and Config notwithstanding), but they really don't know that there's a tool that does a lot of the work for them in porting their custom modules.</p>

<p>could we design a quick permanent survey for people who recently considered backdrop but didn't? so people like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256627">@oadaeh (Jason Flatt)</span> can just include a link at the end of one of your  emails? asking "we heard you passed on using backdrop please answer our 2 question survey", and also optionally collect their email permission to keep them informed.</p>

<p>I'm still in the boat of "get infront of those users". The BUS module is the single best way to show d7 users how close (or far) they are away from being able to move their site from D7 to Backdrop.</p>
<p>Just knowing about Backdrop isn't enough. Showing some of the differences isn't enough. Showing them "your site is 90% ready to be ported" is what that userbase is going to be the most interested in.</p>
<p>I speak from experience. I could have cared less about Backdrop as an option until I found out that Ubercart was ported. That's what got me excited. Then I ran into the wall of realizing some of the powerhouse modules I need (for example entity reference) isn't available yet.</p>
<p>I'm now in a holding pattern of learn more but not looking to port anytime soon.</p>
<p>Point is, if we aren't able to show D7 users a clear and viable path to move from D7 to Backdrop, BD is nothing more than a novelty idea (to those users) that works but isn't polished enough to consider for mainstream porting. Maybe it's good enough as a small basic site to get the feet wet or good to start a brand new site on for moving forward, but if we can't prove to them it is good enough to port a tenured site, they are going to continue to weigh their options with more established projects and keep Backdrop in the far back of their minds.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> still question though: do they know Backdrop exists? They'll only get to BUS module if the answer is yes.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256757">@docwilmot</span> Agreed.</p>
<p>However I don't feel like it's a good idea to get the BUS module in front of people if they're going to see say 30% of their site is ready for being ported. If we can get that closer to 65% or 75% for most sites, people will be much more willing to look closely at Backdrop as an option. This is why I would like to see the telemetry added to BUS, so we can see where to address focus and get more D7 sites to a 65 - 75% portability status.</p>
<p>But yes, we need to get BUS and Backdrop in front of more Drupal folks as a viable option.</p>

<p>I did some research on SEO for Backdrop, and also sponsored a small Google Ads Campaign. The assumption was that people looking for "drupal alternative(s)" on Google might be pretty interesting target groups (while others are also welcome). Here are some key results... we are not even close to where we should be. This is how much organic SEO traffic we got for "drupal alternatives" during the past 12 months: FOUR clicks (organic only)</p>

<p>So... I could not invest much time on improving SEO ranking for our website (as I promised earlier this year), but I will invest more during the weeks to come. Theres a high demand for "drupal alternatives", and we must (and will) perform better on this SEO-wise.</p>

<p>Traffic for keywords with "drupal 7" included (e.g. D7 EOL) was surprisingly low. I am fully aware that a some "drupal alternative" searches are not searching for what Backdrop has to offer. So to put it short, I do not have enough information on the search intention;-)</p>

<p>well, it's always SEO and SEA at the same time. You start with the keywords that already rank on a certain level... but right now, we are at a point where further investigation is not priority <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1">#1</a>... when you have 5000 search queries for "drupal alternative",  resulting in 4 clicks, you better start to optimize pretty quickly, and re-evaluate search intentions after some month, and optimize again.</p>

I think by improving the ranking of <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a>, you will also be improving the Backdrop CMS product in this way (at least a little bit), and I am interested in helping with that.</p>
