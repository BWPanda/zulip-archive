<p>Currently we have:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/backdrop">https://github.com/backdrop</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/backdrop-ops">https://github.com/backdrop-ops</a></p>
<p>/backdrop is designated for core code<br>
/backdrop-ops is designated for "Operations"</p>
<p>What you see in /backdrop-ops are issue queues that are primarily for issues related to websites or code with only one single queue designated to "the community" which is conduct</p>
<p>What I would like to see is a third github group added where discussion and issues for the community can be addressed. Conduct should be moved in there as an example.</p>
<p>I feel like we need a designated location to address community topics that aren't related to code or fixing things on sites.</p>
<p>What is the general consensus on this idea and who has the github permissions to be able to open this group?</p>

<p>I disagree with the need for a whole new organisation/group. I think <em>if</em> we decide a new repo/issue queue is needed for community discussion, then it can just go into <code>backdrop-ops</code>. But I'm not even convinced of that yet...</p>

<p>The forums are where the community can discuss and ask questions, but I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> is referring to a place where more formal discussions and decisions can be made <em>about</em> the community...</p>

<p>Correct</p>

<p>Well I disagree that we DON'T need another group! :P No, it's difficult to know where to talk about "funding" or "marketing" or "grants" or "donations" or "code of conduct". Things that aren't specific to This needs added to the .org site or That needs fixed on the .org site.</p>
<p>When we talk about these things in /backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org, are we talking about adding the information to the website <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a>? or are we talking about BackDrop as a whole project and how it affects the community?</p>
<p>I would like to see /backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org reserved for things that are specific to the <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> site, and a new group that allows discussion around "Backdrop".</p>
<p>Loose example scenarios using the <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> repository for these discussions:<br>
Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1">#1</a>: Fix the text on the /news page that says "helloo". This should be "Hello".<br>
Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2">#2</a>: How should we deal with bad actors on Zulip?<br>
Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3">#3</a>: Add a new content type for "suggested modules"<br>
Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4">#4</a>: Who has done the research to find out where to apply for Grants?</p>
<p>Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1">#1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/3">#3</a> deal with the site <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a><br>
Issue <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2">#2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/4">#4</a> deal with Backdrop as the community/project</p>
<p><a href="http://Backdropcms.org">Backdropcms.org</a> is NOT the community in my mind, it's the frontend website to the project. As the community continues to grow, code and site fixes need to be separate from project policies and project discussions.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> Can you please give reasons why you believe we need a new group with a new repo (like <code>backdrop-community/community</code>) vs. just adding a new repo to the existing group (like <code>backdrop-ops/community</code>)? Your reasons so far seem to be why the <code>backdropcms.org</code> <em>repo</em> isn't suitable, which I understand, but I don't see the need for a whole new <em>group</em>...</p>

<p>We need a place that isn't focused on software related discussions but can still be tracked for progress of the overall project discussion. The forums are great for ideas and discussion, but not a good place for keeping track of progress on a discussion.</p>
<p>Merging project discussions/tasks with software discussions/tasks is muddying the waters.</p>
<p>Bringing this full circle back to the "Funding" discussion, why would we put discussion about funding inside <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> when <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> should really only be reserved for fixing things on <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a>? Adding Funding to /backdrop-ops doesn't make sense to me either when 99% of the other repositories are all software, file or code related... Hence, I think the community could benefit from a new group that handles all discussion that isn't about the software.</p>

<p>I see <code>backdrop</code> as being for core, <code>backdrop-contrib</code> as being for contrib projects, and <code>backdrop-ops</code> being for <em>everything else</em>. Yes there are code-related things in there, and site-related things in there, but there are also community/miscellaneous things in there too.</p>

<p>Because "structure and organization". When it's 5 people doing 90% of the discussion and most of it is kept in Google spreadsheets that are all shared amongst those 5 people, structure and organization is easy to throw out the window.</p>
<p>There were 30+ people attending backdrop live and the numbers will continue to grow as D7 nears EoL.</p>
<p>If this is going to be a project built by the community for the community, it needs the proper structure and logical organization to accept that growth and be prepared for it. That is, if existing members want that growth.</p>
<p>If the general consensus is to remain a small community that doesn't want to be taken seriously, then I'm fine with throwing things nilly-willy wherever it feels good, makes no logical sense and calling it a day. But from what I've gathered, the current community wants the growth and wants to be taken serious, thus it needs to be prepared for that growth.</p>
<p>I would never store my bathroom towels with the kitchen utensils, and I would never store my Sunday suit in the mower shed. Why would we want to house and combine philosophical discussions about the community with website to-do tasks and then throw all of those philosophical discussions into a single unorganized bucket?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> you are missing the point I believe. <code>/backdrop-ops</code> is not about websites/infrastructure alone; it is about anything required for and related to the Backdrop community (anything except Backdrop the product/core, and except Backdrop contrib code). The <code>/backdrop-ops</code> group was never created with the sole purpose of holding website code. Not sure why a separate GitHub <em>group</em> is required. Keeping all backdrop-related things under the same GitHub group allows better managing the members of the group/organization. The ops group for example also holds the contrib applications/discussions (<code>backdrop-ops/contrib</code>) ...I don't see how this is limiting our community growth.</p>

<p>Have you ever been confused reading an issue, wondering if it was suggesting we add a new view on the main <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a> site or the forum site? No, because they are two separate repos with separate issue queues. Issues in <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> refer to that site, and issues in <a href="http://forum.backdropcms.org">forum.backdropcms.org</a> refer to that site. There's no problem with them both being in the same group, they're still separate repos/issue queues.</p>

<p>I now have to wonder: "What is the real reason for not creating a new group?"</p>
<p>There is an underlying reason why both of you (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256607">@BWPanda</span> ) are bucking the idea and I haven't had a good explanation why.</p>
<p>"Put everything else into ops..." This was a great bucket 4-5 years ago when there were 2-3 repos to deal with. Is it really going to be a good bucket 10-15 years from now with 40+ different repos and half of them have absolutely nothing in common with the others?</p>
<p>Alright, so <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> let's not do just a catch-all "community" repo in OPS. Here's a list of repos we need to get added in addition to the existing Conduct, Leadership and PMC repos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outreach</li>
<li>Policies</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Roadmap</li>
<li>Funding</li>
<li>Infrastructure-Overhead</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Initatives</li>
<li>License-Copyright</li>
<li>General</li>
</ul>
<p>Give me a few more days and I'm sure I'll come up with some more repos to efficiently segregate community discussions.</p>

<p>I'm not too worried either way. One curve ball, to throw in. If we create a group in GitHub, (and I can really see the benefits of that from versioning etc.) would that put off non-technical people from contributing?</p>

<p>Thanks for chiming in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387384">@yorkshirepudding</span> ...versioning is available on the REPOSITORY level - doesn't have to be a separate GitHub GROUP. ...furthermore, we can start by adding any additonal repositories we need under <code>/backdrop-ops/*</code> and if we indeed decide that a new GROUP is required/appropriate, then we can move any repositories around. Deciding on whether to create a new GROUP or not should not be a blocker for creating any REPOSITORY we need now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I now have to wonder: "What is the real reason for not creating a new group?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the answer to this question is pretty simple. We have so many places/forums/repos for engagement already and new members of the community frequently complain that they find it confusing and difficult to navigate. We are frequently confronted with requests to create new place for communication (sometimes from me) that risk dispersing the engagement we already have and increasing the number of places that active members of the community need to pay attention to and engage with.</p>
<p>I agree that <a href="https://github.com/backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org">https://github.com/backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org</a> is not the most intuitive place to have the kinds of community discussions you are suggesting. I also think that active members of the community have real reasons to be concerned about creating additional forms of communication, especially what by implication could become a new "group" of forums. </p>
<p>We are under some pressure to consolidate these forums and here we have a request to expand them. </p>
<p>I think that the problem is real and that the proposal is reasonable. But, I also think it's very reasonable for active members of the community to be concerned about this ongoing expansion of forums/repos that is already confusing and hard to keep up with. I am not entirely opposed to a new repo/issue queue - but, I'd like to be deliberate and thoughtful about it and avoid making existing problems worse.</p>

<p>This discussion has now convinced me of the need for a separate repository/issue queue to discuss community/miscellaneous issues outside of the <code>backdropcms.org</code> website-specific queue.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> I wondered about moving things around, so yes, if it is easy to move from one group to another, then creating repos here and moving them later is an option. Not a great option IMO because links will have to be moved, site documentation fixed etc which just creates additional overhead for someone later. "less work now for more work later."</p>
<p>Speaking of overhead as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> mentioned, I can see where having yet another area of discussion when other areas are trying to be consolidated is a possible problem, however, looking at how the <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> website mentions the different github pages and repositories, it's no wonder why the different places for discussion are so confusing to understand.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256607">@BWPanda</span> The reason I don't like the idea of a single "community" repo is because it takes too much time to weed through the cruft of issues that have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The core issue queue is a great example where ideas are muddled in with bug fixes. Sure they all result in code change but trying to weed through and find one or the other? Not fun.</p>
<p>The other reason is because many of the specific repos I mentioned in my previous thread, need their own .md files to house any policies or hardline discussion that are formed through the topics discussion from within issues inside that repos queue. We need a way to formalize the discussion and put it into a formal document for many of those discussions. I don't like the idea of having a different .md file for each and every major discussion topic inside one repo, especially when some of the topics may need 2 or more document files to outline the policies and guidelines.</p>
<p>Will a single repo to house all discussion work? Yes. It's just not ideal for organizing thoughts and discussion.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wasn't sure about labels being global or defined per repo so doing some research I found out labels are defined per repo. That said, I am still not fine with a single "community" repo but at least we can create labels for each of the different areas of discussion. It will work in the short and interim, but It's going to be a very poor organizational structure for the long term. The problem with labels? They only work when they are used properly.</p>
<p>If you're going to do it anyway because "manpower" then let's not call it "community" but rather "community-discussion". At least make the repo name descriptive to what it's used for.</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> ...I think that a single <code>/community</code> repo + labels should work just fine. We can have labels for all the things you mentioned in your earlier comment, such as <code>type - outreach</code>, <code>type - policy</code>, <code>type - infrastructure</code> etc. and that will in fact allow us to be able to add multiple labels in an issue. Then we can have <code>needs - feedback</code>, <code>needs - vote</code>, <code>needs - documentation</code>, <code>needs - usage metrics</code>, <code>needs - pmc decision</code> etc. labels ...and also labels such as <code>status - postponed</code>, <code>status - rejected</code>, <code>status - duplicate</code> etc.</p>

<p>I will post my thoughts here in case they're not appropriate for what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> envisions for that issue (i.e. if that issue is just for voting on one of the proposed ideas, I don't want to start up another discussion there about the pros &amp; cons of each option).

<p>What I want to say is that with <em>so many</em> different proposed repos/labels:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will inevitably come a point where people will be unsure where their particular idea/discussion topic should go (e.g. should it go in Policies, Philosophy or Roadmap...?)</li>
<li>Best case scenario: they post it to the wrong place. Worst case: they don't post it at all.</li>
<li>When that happens (posting to the wrong place), it'll be much harder (<del>if not impossible</del>) to move it to a different repo/issue queue. On the other hand, it's extremely simple to just change the label.</li>

Plus I would like us to "economize". ...how many policy issues do we have to discuss/decide over the course of a year? ...2? ...3? ...a dozen perhaps? ....then why have an entire repo just for policies? Same with funding/monetizing and other "categories" or community-related topics/issues. To me, this sounds as absurd as saying that we should split the issues repo into 3 different ones for bugs/tasks/features. These are all code changes, just of different type; so labels instead of separate repos seems the reasonable thing to be doing.</p>

<p>I can understand where a single repo makes sense. However I see each discussion repo as a different project, much like we have different repos for each subdomain of each <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a> website. We could easily create 1 repo for all <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a> sites, but that becomes cluttered and confusing.</p>
<p>I just don't see a single repo scaling for future growth. It will be a lot of work to maintain labels for every single issue just to keep them organized. Maybe I'm wrong but I have a strong feeling it will be easy in the beginning but become more difficult over time.</p>
<p>Either way, I'll just be happy to see a place outside of the <a href="http://b.org">b.org</a> repo.</p>

<p>On a side note, I don't think long term we should hold the discussions on github anyway, but I do still think each main topic warrants its own repo to keep track of any changes to the policies within those topics.</p>

<p>I also want to present options to the community and let the community decide on the best way to hold discussions. The handful of voices here are hardly a voice for the overall community.</p>

<p>Indeed, however you'll find that 80%* of the community are passive users, and that only a few get involved in most discussions/decisions. Certainly keep the issue open for more feedback, but don't be surprised if you don't hear from many more people who are already expressing themselves here...</p>
<p>\* Made-up number, but you get my point.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268468">@findlabnet(Vladimir)</span> my one concern with using forums is that it isn't easy to engage in discussion from mobile. Web based engagement on mobile is doable, but just not as elegant as a dedicated app experience.</p>
