I seldom change change the home page path anymore, because the home page layout is so flexible that I can do almost anything I want with it. </p>\n<p>If I want a node on the front page, I drop a node block onto the front page. If I want a view on the front page, I drop a view block onto the front page layout. I have a hard time thinking of a reason why I would want to change the default home page in Backdrop (unlike Drupal 7).</p>",
