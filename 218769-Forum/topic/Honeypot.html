<p>A new user just had trouble creating a Forum account. Looks like it was because he was too quick and Honeypot blocked him. Can we reduce the time for that, or just remove it in favour of something else like Antibot?</p>

<p>Just checked the settings and Honeypot's time limit is set to 7 seconds. That seems quite long, considering spambots would be submitting forms in under a second or two I would guess... I'd suggest 3 seconds for this setting.</p>
