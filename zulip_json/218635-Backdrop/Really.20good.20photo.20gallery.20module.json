I can do the slideshow/gallery thing with views, but it's not easy for the user to interact with - it's not user friendly.

I have one Drupal client for which this a BIG deal - they have hundreds of images in many galleries (total images are in the high thousands)  and it would be a nightmare to port to Backdrop at this point.  Something that I have to keep in mind.  They are also not a candidate for Wordpress.</p>",

I've used several of them on Wordpress sites and they all have the ease of use I'm looking for.  Drupal really lagged in this area, and I haven't seen much like it on Backdrop yet. I'm hoping someone knows of a gallery module that's been added since I last looked or one I don't know about.  One thing ALL the Wordpress photo modules lack is file and directory management, which means that looking for one file out of thousands can be a nightmare and it is an issue on some of my Wordpress sites, so I really don't want to go that route for galleries if I can avoid it.  Looking for suggestions or ideas I haven't thought of, NOT for someone to write code or port a module for me.

That's media gallery, and I just checked today - it hasn't been ported to Backdrop - or at least it's not publicly available on the backdrop modules.  And I don't want to, because as I have said before , it has dependencies, and the module on Drupal is buggy to say the least - and I can say that because I've had to fix it on every site and have used it since 2012.  That would be a lot of sites. I like the way it works, but I don't think it would be easy or simple to port and fix all the bugs and issues.  I think there would be a fair amount of changes to be made to have it work with Backdrop without requiring lots of bug fixes.  I wouldn't ask anyone else to either, but someone may have come up with a different solution that I don't know about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/modules?s=media+gallery\">https://backdropcms.org/modules?s=media+gallery</a></p>\n<p>And as to your other comments - please read the thread. Backdrop's core file upload functionality sucks for large numbers of files and directory management.  That is why my clients on Backdrop use IMCE (that's a separate thread).  The core media library browser can't handle large numbers of files, subdirectories and so on...  I haven't seen a module in Backdrop  that just allows a user to click on a button, upload a large number of files and then just drag and drop them in the order they want, move them around, add titles and captions and do this all simply and easily by going to content -add gallery.  Yes, the lightbox functionality is there, but that's colorbox, not media gallery and not my issue.  </p>\n<p>I've used views gallery on another Backdrop site, and it's not a good solution for photo galleries.  It works great when the client wants me to just deal with it for a small number of files, or just wants to add one image at a time and have the gallery immediately re-order by date - but those aren't photos, they're magazine issues (just one example - views gallery works for this client, but they don't do a lot of photo galleries).  </p>\n<p>Most of my photo galleries, the client wants to be able to move them around, play with the photos maybe delete one and then add another, until it looks the way they want.  And they want to easily be able to do this.  All the functionality i'm talking about exists for Wordpress plugins, but I'd rather do it in Backdrop for clients with lots of photo galleries.</p>",

Media is in core now.  I hadn't found one that met needs adequately.  There were some that were more like views galleria, where the photo gallery was more of a display, nothing you could interact with.  Ex - photoswipe and others.  Photoswipe was ported, but I haven't seen that it enables the user to be able to drag and drop reorder photos and add captions  &amp; titles like media gallery while in view mode (or delete an image from the gallery  and add one).

It doesn't meet my main requirement, which is the drag &amp; drop and ability to edit the gallery via the front end.   Which would require a substantial amount of code and a custom module or a 3rd party contrib.  The above is pretty much just a field formatter and there's any number of solutions for that.  You could try Photoswipe gallery, which is quite nice although it lacks my main requirement.  Views gallery also does the above and is fairly flexible.</p>",

I just wanted to save you some work.  The photoswipe module (<a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/modules?s=photoswipe\">https://backdropcms.org/modules?s=photoswipe</a>) and views gallery look like they both do what you describe robustly without having to write any code.  I've used views gallery and that works fine.  Photoswipe looks like it already does what you need as well.   My needs are because these are sites where the main point is the photo galleries, so the needs are pretty critical on those.   It's not an uncommon need either, or there wouldn't be tons of Wordpress modules that do exactly what I want.  I just can't port any of them because they are not open source.  The one I could port is messy (media gallery) and buggy, and probably cheaper to rewrite from scratch - which I can't do, because I have no budget to do unpaid work.</p>",

Smaller agencies just don't have the resources to do unpaid work.  <br>\nOne of the biggest problems with Drupal modules can be the lack of support - CRM Core for example.  We chose it for a client over CivicRM, because CivicRM was way to expensive and massive overkill for the clients budget.  We also talked to the module developers about our concerns for ongoing support for the modules. They assured us that it wouldn't be a problem, and yet less than 2 years after those modules were released, they were unsupported and no bug fixes were released.  I now have a client with unsupported modules that I can't remove because it's core functionality.  Nor can I do major fixes that are needed for those modules because the client can't pay for it.  If the developers could charge nominal fees for ongoing support, this would help both sides.  Not as monetized as Wordpress, but somewhere in the middle.  That's my opinion, anyway.</p>",

It's an image field formatter like photoswipe module and it hasn't been ported from Drupal 7.  There's multiple options that let you format from the backend for drupal, but only one (media gallery)  that I've found that lets the client drag &amp; drop, add, remove and add titles &amp; captions from front end (they have to be logged in and have permissions - this is not for just any viewer) in view mode.</p>",
