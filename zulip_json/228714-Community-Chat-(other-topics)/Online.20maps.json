I lived across the road from a supermarket, which was there when I arrived in March 2018. On Bing maps that supermarket is nowhere to be seen - it's just a forest! Don't know where/how Bing maps gets their aerial photographs, but they're very out-of-date, especially when compared with Google's.</p>",
