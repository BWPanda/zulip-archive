Using both is pretty effective and we haven't had a problem with it.  There are some other modules that are available as well, but the combination of these 2 is what worked the best for us.  We have over 100 sites, some Backdrop, some Wordpress and some still in Drupal and the modules are available on all 3 platforms.  Wordpress has more spam filtering available, but it's also hit much harder by spam bots.   There are some other resources available as well, but try these 2 first.  It's by far the simplest and quickest to set up.  FYI, we have one gmail account that we use for all site recaptchas so that we don't have to bother the client, even if they have their own gmail account for other things.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Garbeil, Brainwrap LLC<br>\n810-560-7181, <a href=\"mailto:egaba@brainwrap.com\">egaba@brainwrap.com</a><br>\n<span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"302871\">Steve Moorhouse</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/218635-Backdrop/topic/hook_views_default_views()/near/207403937\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Afternoon....</p>\n<p>We've got a lot of Drupal sites I will be migrating over to BD in the next six months or so... </p>\n<p>The problem I and my customers have is with webforms and \"contact us\" forms and spam.
