It is not enough for OG module. Can anybody continue my unfinished porting?</p>\n<p>These are my thoughts on your questions:<br>\n1) I guess yes. I think we need Organic Group module too, if we want to captivate the D7 users. It is included in the list of top 125 modules (by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256757\">@docwilmot</span> ): <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/34\">https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/34</a><br>\n2) I think the problem is the complexity. Consider the number of D7 users of OG, and the OG module is the dependecy of other modules.<br>\n3) I think yes, and we should file an issue at <code>backdrop-ops/contrib</code> if we find a too compex (and important) module for an average porting programmer.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/34\" style=\"background-image: url(https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8452564?s=400&amp;v=4)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/issues/34\" title=\"How are we doing so far? · Issue #34 · backdrop-ops/contrib\">How are we doing so far? · Issue #34 · backdrop-ops/contrib</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Drupal 7.x modules list by most installed (top 125): (thought it would be nice to see what&#39;s missing - we&#39;re not doing too bad!)
