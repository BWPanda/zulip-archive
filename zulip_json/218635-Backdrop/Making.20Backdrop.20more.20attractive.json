The BUS module is the single best way to show d7 users how close (or far) they are away from being able to move their site from D7 to Backdrop.</p>\n<p>Just knowing about Backdrop isn't enough. Showing some of the differences isn't enough. Showing them \"your site is 90% ready to be ported\" is what that userbase is going to be the most interested in.</p>\n<p>I speak from experience. I could have cared less about Backdrop as an option until I found out that Ubercart was ported. That's what got me excited. Then I ran into the wall of realizing some of the powerhouse modules I need (for example entity reference) isn't available yet.</p>\n<p>I'm now in a holding pattern of learn more but not looking to port anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Point is, if we aren't able to show D7 users a clear and viable path to move from D7 to Backdrop, BD is nothing more than a novelty idea (to those users) that works but isn't polished enough to consider for mainstream porting. Maybe it's good enough as a small basic site to get the feet wet or good to start a brand new site on for moving forward, but if we can't prove to them it is good enough to port a tenured site, they are going to continue to weigh their options with more established projects and keep Backdrop in the far back of their minds.</p>",

If we can get that closer to 65% or 75% for most sites, people will be much more willing to look closely at Backdrop as an option.
