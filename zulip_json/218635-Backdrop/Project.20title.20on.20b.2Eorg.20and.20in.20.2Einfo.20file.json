And should the title in those two places always be the same?</p>\n<p>I ask because I observe that on <a href=\"http://drupal.org/projects\">drupal.org/projects</a>, the project page title isn't necessarily the same as the module title in its .info file. For example, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/uc_price_per_role\">Project title</a> = \"Ubercart Price Per Role\", but module title in .info file is \"Price per role\".</p>\n<p>In that case, it seems to make sense to have \"Ubercart\" in the title on the project page, but not in the module listing on the website (capitalization ought to be the same, though). Wondering if a similar situation is possible (and/or recommended) with BD's project listing.</p>",

Since module names are proper names, it should be capitalized as a proper name (e.g., \"Dragon Builder\", not \"dragon builder\" or \"Dragon builder\"), and it should be a human-readable name (not dragon_builder). If your module name includes an acronym (CSS, WYSIWYG, UI, etc.) or a third-party trade name (jQuery, JavaScript), of course follow the standard capitalization for those.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the name in the .info file should be \"Price Per Role\"</p>",
