<p>In the blocks meta (<a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1427">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1427</a>) we have <a href="https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/100">https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/100</a> listed as what seems to have initially been a task/request for fieldable blocks, but that evolved into the "rabbit hole" feature for content types. ...I'm trying to wrap my head around use cases for fieldable blocks in D8/D9, and if the respective feature we have implemented in Backdrop core is enough to cover those use cases.</p>

<p>...I'm aware that we have the "Existing content" block type, and also able to place individual fields as blocks if the context specified for the layout is set to <code>node/%</code></p>

<p>It's actually easier to use a content type, hide the path for visitors and include the node(s) in a layout. Easier for users and easier for admins. And if only some parts of a node are needed, a custom layout context will help.</p>

<p>...the video also mentions that besides visibility conditions, there were "actions" that could for example conditionally "move" (render) the block to a different region. Do people use that or find that a potentially useful thing?</p>
