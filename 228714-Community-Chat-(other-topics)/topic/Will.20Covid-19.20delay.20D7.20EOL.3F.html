<p>I have zero evidence or insight but I'm wondering if there'll be a move to delay the D7 EOL. Discuss</p>

<p>I think that the EOL deadline is far enough away that unless the effects of CoVid-19 are 8 or months long, it will not change the EOL. Also, the Drupal Association is currently hurting for money, and I think it's more likely that they will cut resources to D7 to save themselves in the hope that people will move to D8 sooner.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the Drupal 7 and 8 are scheduled to reach EOL at the same time. I also understand that the Drupal 8 EOL is somewhat forced by the EOL of Symphony 3. </p>
<p>If Symphony 3 reached EOL on schedule, forcing EOL for Drupal 8, it would seem unlikely (but not impossible) that they would continue to support Drupal 7 after Drupal 8 is no longer supported. However, now that I think about it, if the upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 is as easy as they say, then maybe it doesn't matter?</p>

<p>I will certainly be MUCH easier for Drupal 8 sites to upgrade to Drupal 9 than it will be for Drupal 7 sites.</p>

<p>Dropping support for D8 and leaving D7 on would be admitting that these are two different products. It will be the first time that a version is "skipped" so to say. ...it all depends on numbers I guess. If by Nov 2021 there's still a considerable amount of sites still in D7 (like 100s of thousands), then it would be idiotic to drop support just for the sake of "sticking to the plan".</p>

<p>...as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> said, dropping support for D8 is being "forced" by the 3rd party software being used (Symfony mainly); whereas the reason for dropping D7 is just policy.</p>
