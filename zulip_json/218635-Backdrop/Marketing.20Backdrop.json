Other \"content management systems\" (a.k.a. CMS's) have long claimed that \"Drupal is hard\", \"Drupal is expensive\".Is Drupal hard? Is Drupal 8 even \"harder\"? Is it \"too expensive\" for your non-profit?Does Drupal suck at non-profits?In this article, I take a deep dive, looking at what non-profits need from a website and how well Drupal can provide for those needs.Read on to see what I think, and PLEASE, share your thoughts in the comments below!Note: we posted a follow-up with an idea for a solution to this problem at Drupal 8 has left small non-profits behind... How can we fix that?</div></div></div>",
