It crawls and scrapes content and creates structured json ready for import via migrate api.</p>\n<p>It’s got support for menus, taxonomy, content, paragraphs (incl. reusable paragraphs via library), media, linkit url rewriting, media, and plenty more. It’s also generic by nature, so can be used for migrations to Wordpress, or to create structured data for any other purpose (e.g ecommerce competitive pricing analysis, static site exporter, 404 link checker across sites)..</p>\n<p>We’ll aim to launch a blog series of how-to guides that help explain all the use cases, it’s still early days and an evolving tool but hopefully it’ll become a go-to when people think about content migration.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I have a client who is returning to me after trying something different for the last year, and they've asked me to recommend a host.  Before they left me, I had their thousand-node D7 site hosted on Pantheon, but the developers they gave it to created a parallax Gatsby/React thing with a Wordpress back end.  I need to park the current site somewhere in the US (it's currently hosted in the UK) for now, but then I'll pitch them on letting me maintain it again -- possibly on Backdrop if I can talk them into it, or Drupal if I can't.</p>\n<p>So I'm wondering if there are any hosting providers that offer dev-flow facilities like Pantheon and Acquia Cloud, but that can also host a simple static site.  I've only used Pantheon and ACH.  I'm thinking my answer might be <a href=\"http://Platform.sh\">Platform.sh</a>?
