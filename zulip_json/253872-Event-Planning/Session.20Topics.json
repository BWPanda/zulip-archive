I'm also chatting with some folks in Bangladesh, where the cost is also an issue. The $20 is a suggested donation and the intent is that no one should be prevented from participating. Having said that, I'm not sure we have made this easy enough. </p>\n<p>I would suggest that we create a special discount code (free) that we can offer to folks in this situation.
