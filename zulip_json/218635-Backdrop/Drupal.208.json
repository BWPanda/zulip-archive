I ended up switching to Drupal 8 mainly for the API stuff and a couple other modules I can't remember.   But my time with Backdrop made Drupal 8 much less intimidating.

I've only needed to use Drupal Commerce 2 times in a decade and found it unwieldy.  Ubercart is mostly set up and handles all but a few situations. It's a lot easier and cheaper for most of our clients.  Both cases where we needed Commerce, I would go in a different direction if I could do it over and only one was primarily a store.  For the store, the ROI wasn't good for the client (it cost too much to set up for them) and they ended up shutting it down after a couple of years.  For the other, I'm not sure what I would do - part of it was the kludge that you get with dealing with any nonprofit.  What they wanted didn't match their budget. That's part of what made the switch to Backdrop easy.  Ubercart wasn't supported on D8 yet anyway.  It now is, but I'm not crazy about the D8 version.  Commerce is better on D8 than on D7, but it isn't any less time intensive to set up or maintain.</p>",
