<p>Is it really as complicated to migrate a site as <a href="https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/deploying-backup-migrate">https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/deploying-backup-migrate</a>?</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307683">@Kevin Golding</span> <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> ...that process makes certain assumptions, and is for a specific use case. The simplest way to migrate a site would be to backup the codebase and the database, and migrate/copy these over.</p>

<p>I suppose I was hoping to be able to do a backup and then restore it to another server like  Akeeba Backup for Joomla. It had a kickstart php script that would run on the new server and restore the backup and make any changes to the settings as needed. Nice feature.</p>

<p>That sounds like a useful feature <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="307683">@Kevin Golding</span> - Perhaps you could add a feature request here <a href="https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate/issues">https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/backup_migrate/issues</a>. I've personally used Backup and Migrate for years but never used the "migrate" part so have no idea if it works well. Backdrop is a bit special in that you'll need to make sure to backup everything (code, db and files) so as to catch the config files wherever they may be. Maybe it works, not sure.</p>
