<p>If anyone ever has doubts as to how welcoming and nice the Backdrop community is, just look at other open-source projects where requests are just closed without any explanation: <a href="https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2914">https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2914</a></p>

<p>You opened an issue saying "hey, I'd like to help with this project. Could we make it a little eaiser" and reply was to simply close your issue within one hour without any explanation or redirection. Seems like a lost opportunity on their part. </p>
<p>Maybe they have too many people helping them already. ;-)</p>

<p>Sorta unrelated but: The generally good natured attitude of Backdrop is one of the things I appreciate the most.  Even when things get heated I've seen people say "that was a little harsh, sorry..." which is just plain grown-up behavior.  A little humility goes a long way to a healthy community that people want to join.</p>
