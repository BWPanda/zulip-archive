<p>Yesterday I've finally watched the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)</a> Highly recommended if you haven't watched it yet. Will make you sad about how terrifying ways technologies in hands of big corporations screw up everything in environment including humans. Watch the stats in the very end of the movie. Maybe you already knew, but some will be very much surprised to learn they are also poisoned with C8.</p>
