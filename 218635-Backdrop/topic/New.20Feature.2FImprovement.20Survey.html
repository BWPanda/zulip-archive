<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256627">@oadaeh (Jason Flatt)</span> - It means that this is a survey of people that are actively involved in the community. Much the way that decisions made during development meetings are inherently skewed towards the opinions of those who show up at meetings. In my view, it's important that we do keep that in mind and never suggest that the results of this survey are anything more than a snapshot of the opinions of those who in Zulip. </p>
<p>I would love to do a broader survey of the community with much greater outreach to end users. I view this survey as a first step in that direction. I see this as an experiment leading towards a much more representative survey in the future. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>mostly features a developer would want will be voted up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be true, but I would not assume it. Many of our most active members in the community do not consider themselves developers and some of the developers are very vocal in their advocacy for issues that are most needed by end users. I've recently heard the suggestion that core development may be skewed against the needs of developers, so personally I'm not overly concerned about this becoming too developer centric or at least any more skewed towards developers than our existing tools are. </p>
<p>Certainly, the results of this survey should not be portrayed as anything more than a experimental snapshot of the opinions of those most active in the Zulip portion of the community - leading towards better and more representative surveys in the future.</p>

<p>I am open to doing making this survey much more public, but my fear is that will require much more work. Issues are not well defined or described in his survey and I don't have the time to polish the titles and descriptions. My fear, is that if we widely publicize the existing survey we'll get lots of criticism for not making it much easier to use. </p>
<p>In my view, the current state of the survey is good for folks who are active in the community and understand how to use github, but that it would be confusing to a user that is uncomfortable with github.</p>

<p>But, if there is consensus that the survey in it's existing form would be usable to our newsletter audience, I don't object. I just anticipate that as soon as that decision is made, I'm going to get lots of usability feedback that I don't have time to process right now.</p>

<p>If we make it clear that this is experimental, and that we are simply trying out an idea we had, I don't think that we'd be upsetting anybody.</p>

<p>If making it widely public somes with a list of 20 new features and improvements, then I will turn the site over to someone else to make those improvements. I don't have time right now.</p>

<p>Maybe the effort isn't that relevant yet, when asking people for (personal) preferences. The survey's probably more about figuring out the most desired / needed / wanted things from a user perspective. At least, that's how I interpret it - maybe I'm wrong <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>Not sure. Considering my own (sort of anarchist) approach to either do what I currently need/want most, or do what seems like being most exciting to implement... I wouldn't do anything quicker in an Open Source project, just because it's not much work - but maybe that's just me. <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>
<p>What the ranking by user desire <em>could</em> do is that someone picks up a task, because more people than expected seem to need it, and it was on a todo-list anyway, but further down.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256705">@Herb</span> that some attempt to categorize how difficult each issue is would be helpful. I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256738">@indigoxela</span> that given the nature of an open source project, it's value is limited. </p>
<p>Most of my concerns around this version of the survey is how quickly (and somewhat sloppy) the list is. For the broader Backdrop user base, I think we need to provide better titles, descriptions, and more context around each issue. These are things to think about prior to version 2 of this survey.</p>
<p>I think some broad sense of how difficult an issue is might inform some users selections in that if they know an issue is very difficult, they might prioritize one that is easier instead.</p>

<p>I see version 1 of the survey as a proof of concept, and I think, it's a cool idea, worth to further elaborate. Sloppy? Possibly, but a great starting point. Many thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> to get this going.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> - No, I whipped this up pretty quickly using Simplo as a proof of concept. This is still on my own infrastructure. If we want to keep this, we'll need to decide if it is a stand alone site on <a href="http://B.org">B.org</a> infrastructure or if we will incorporate the features in the Forum (which has been suggested).</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> ...it can stay in your repo/infrastructure while we flesh out features/design etc. and can move it when ready.
