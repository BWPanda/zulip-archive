This was because they have quite a few vocabularies and when they looked at the Dashboard they saw all the links to create new content of the different content types, but no links to create new terms of their vocabularies, so they thought they were missing. I pointed out the difference between terms and nodes, and showed them on the Dashboard where they can see and add terms, but it made me think - do we expect users to know the difference between content and terms and to look in different places in order to list and create them, or should we have them all under the one place (i.e. a Create Content block/menu that has links for content types <em>and</em> terms)?</p>",
