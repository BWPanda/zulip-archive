There's too much competition already and it doesn't bring anything of value that the others don't already have to a complete novice.  Where Backdrop really shines is where D7 used to be - the one up from small scale, where there will be multiple users and/or lots of content and some complexity.  Wordpress sucks when you start getting into the more complex stuff like group permissions and file management.  It doesn't have much for that out of the box and all the tools have to essentially sit on top of Wordpress, not well integrated.  I also found Backdrop/Ubercart to be a much better performer and much more competitive for a small to medium e-commerce store than Wordpress is.  I have stores on both, and Wordpress definitely lags compared to Backdrop in  function, performance and usability.  It's perfect for the $1500 and up sites.  I even prefer it with the smaller sites if the customer doesn't have preference.  We're a small agency, so I don't have the resources for D8 or D9 and my clients aren't willing to pay for it.  They will pay for Backdrop or Wordpress.</p>",
