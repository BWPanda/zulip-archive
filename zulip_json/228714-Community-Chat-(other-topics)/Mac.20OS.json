I decided to try Elementary OS (which has a Mac-like look and feel to it), but ultimately it wasn't as customisable as I needed it to be. I still wanted something different, so then I tried Ubuntu Budgie. It had a similar look and feel as Elementary, but was much more customisable. However after a while I noticed a few things I didn't like. I ended up going back to Linux Mint as that's what I'm comfortable with and can work much better with it. But I might try Budgie again in the future and see if spending some more time with it doesn't fix the issues I was having...</p>",
