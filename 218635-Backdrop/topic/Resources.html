<p>I like this article by Matthew Tift, whom I consider a friend and mentor. <br>

<p>I think Matthew would agree that much of what he says applies to open source in general and certainly to the Backdrop CMS community.</p>

<p>This stuff is scarier by the hour almost. As I said in another thread I still sort of have a job, however I'm not supposed to do any of it.  The city has money budgeted until October so I don't really foresee anything changing until then.  It is worrying though.  On the positive side, I have what I've desired for the last couple of years.  I have time now.  I don't really know any any of you folks, but I might be asking for advice in the coming months anyway.</p>
