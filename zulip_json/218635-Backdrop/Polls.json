I keep setting the admin bar to sticky on the sandboxes I work on (which reminds me the same thing I used to do with disabling the Overlay module in D7 <span aria-label=\"rolling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f644\" role=\"img\" title=\"rolling eyes\">:rolling_eyes:</span>  ), and then also:<br>\na) WordPress has its admin menu on the side, which makes it available at all times; whereas with Backdrop, it is hidden when you scroll down long pages, and then you need to scroll back up to navigate elsewhere. So it is a UX issue that's always at the back of my head, and I keep being reminded of it each time I spin up a WP demo.<br>\nb) <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/1842\">#1842</a> would be another way to solve this I guess, but yet again we'd have to make it the default OOTB.<br>\nc) I really like <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gin\">https://www.drupal.org/project/gin</a> which also has the admin bar on the side.</p>",
