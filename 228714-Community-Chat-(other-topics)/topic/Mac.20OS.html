<p>so I've spent the better part of this week using macOS without the dock. It's been interesting. You really dont need it as much as you might think.</p>

<p>I've spent the better part of the last two months seriously using a Mac for the first time, and I cannot wait to get off it. The key combinations have totally screwed up my muscle memory.</p>

<p>I just got a new laptop and decided to try something a bit different (was previously using Linux Mint Cinnamon). I decided to try Elementary OS (which has a Mac-like look and feel to it), but ultimately it wasn't as customisable as I needed it to be. I still wanted something different, so then I tried Ubuntu Budgie. It had a similar look and feel as Elementary, but was much more customisable. However after a while I noticed a few things I didn't like. I ended up going back to Linux Mint as that's what I'm comfortable with and can work much better with it. But I might try Budgie again in the future and see if spending some more time with it doesn't fix the issues I was having...</p>

Double click on a title bar to collapse the window and an application switcher in the menu bar.</p>
