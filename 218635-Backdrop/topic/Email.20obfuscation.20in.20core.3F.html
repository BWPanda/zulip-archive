<p>Anyone think it's worth putting email obfuscation into core? Anyone have experience/knowledge of the accessibility of obfuscation?

<p>In case anyone's wondering,... Email obfuscation is an anti-spam technique where email addresses are converted into code that the browser can read (so users still see the regular email address), but spambots can't. To varying degrees of success. This is what the Invisimail contrib module does, so this issue is basically about getting that into core.</p>

<p>I feel like this is important to protect people who are new to the web and don't understand the ramifications of putting an email address out on a website.</p>
<p>It's additional code to have to add and maintain though, so is that part of it worth it?</p>
