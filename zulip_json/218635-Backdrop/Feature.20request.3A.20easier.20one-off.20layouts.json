How about a contextual menu on a page, or a new tab on the Layout editor, that says \"Enable custom layout for this page/the referring page\". That should clone the existing layout, set it to only work on the existing path, maybe name it [Referring Page Title] Layout, and drop me back into the Layout editor.</p>\n<p>Even better: when I go to the Layout editor from a particular screen, why not put a drop menu next to the Layout title so I can switch layouts on the fly? Put \"add new...\" on the bottom and life is easy. </p>\n<p>I'll add, FWIW, that every time I have to do this, I completely forget that I want the Path field to be node/% and that the specific path is a Visibility condition.</p>",

And in fact, it's fine to have a culture that promotes that—it's why I showed up for the Documentation talk, because I see how much work you're all doing and want to do my bit.</p>\n<p>But <em>at the moment</em> I'm in Zulip or reading docs, I'm here to solve a problem, and that problem is top of mind. Asking me to switch gears and become a Backdrop volunteer <em>at that moment</em> is the worst possible time. And when the answer to a feature request is, \"if you familiarize yourself with the five years of discussions we've had on this topic, you can usefully contribute,\" that's factually correct, but it's not helpful.</p>\n<p>Sorry if this sounds churlish—it's not meant to be. I really wish I had the time to learn the style here, and be less intimidated by GitHub threads, but these are the facts on the ground.</p>",

I normally have at least 2 templates, one for the home page and one for the rest of the pages.   If you just have special blocks and they're all in the same area, it's not really an issue, you just have a list of blocks in one part of the layout.  Not terribly complicated. I have that for one site.  Also, you may want to look at the views - are you using multiple views where you could be using one and using a filter to control the content based on the current page?  It's hard to know how to help you without more details, such as what the views are showing...</p>",
