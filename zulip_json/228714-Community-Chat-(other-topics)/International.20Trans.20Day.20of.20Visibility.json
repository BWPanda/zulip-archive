I suggest the multi-select part for folks who want to do analysis of the data gathered through a gender field, since having some \"standard\" options can help with that aggregation and analysis. But the free-text field lets you get very specific which is great in terms of understanding how folks personally identify and not limiting folks' options.</p>",
