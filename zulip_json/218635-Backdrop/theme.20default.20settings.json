What I envisioned was something like being able to put json configurations in the theme's config/ directory and have it automatically installed in the config_... directory when enabled like with modules.  I am doing some work on the \"Corporate KISS\" theme that I contributed.  It has no settings, but I was hoping to have a way to enable the hero block, with an included default background, in the \"Top\" region of the front page upon first activation so that, out of the box, it would look more like the thumbnail preview.</p>\n<p>My goal is to keep the theme clean of any code other than CSS, completely void of any php or template code, so that it relies fully on Backdrop's core layout system.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Now that I think about it, I can see that this might be a problem though.  If a user already has a hero block enabled with different parameters when they enable the theme, you wouldn't want it to change any of their existing settings.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, what we need is a modification to the hero block configuration dialog to allow you to select an existing file, like with the content editing screen, and give it access to the image/ directory of the theme.  That way I can include a background image with a contributed theme and make it easy for the user to enable it.</p>\n<p>Right now it only has the ability to browse the local file system and upload a new image.  I remember similar discussions prior to the \"SELECT EXISTING FILE\" feature being added to the content editing screen.  Really, anywhere that prompts you to select a file, should have the ability to select from existing files that have already been uploaded or, in this case included with a theme.</p>",
