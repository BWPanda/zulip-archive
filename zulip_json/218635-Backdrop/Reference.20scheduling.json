The form is always the same, and it doesn't hold a date. It contains only a Name field, contact details, and a checkbox \"I want to attend\". (There is also a token-based read-only field which holds the Event title so that I can filter the submissions by event.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, when I reference the webform as an editor, it will be embedded on the Event page. Then, at the Registration deadline date, I have to disable the form manually. My goal is to build something which disables the form automatically at the deadline date.</p>",
