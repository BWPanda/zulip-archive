<p>I believe the resource of Backdrop itself should be free. Open source is the future. Those with development skills should have no trouble making money through services / website development for those who won't or can't do it for themselves (most of the world). Figure into your pricing a 5% donation to support the platform that you're using to make money. Use that money to support better documentation of your projects or you could figure documentation costs/time into your pricing and charge the customer for the documentation they will need in the future.</p>
<p>Essentially, that 5% you will use to pay yourself for ongoing support of the developments you needed for your customers that were not yet available as a Backdrop resource (theme or module, etc.) Or you could use that 5% you set aside to pay another developer to maintain your contribution. We should just have the attitude to give back. In my case, I have much more time than money, so I donate my time to move many of my interests forward.</p>
<p>Consider creating a marketplace for website development services within the Backdrop ecosystem so that people who need help can find those developers who want to offer free services to non-profits/needy projects or offer real-world pricing to companies that are funded to pay for such services. Everybody wins.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="333206">@Sarvasri</span> I think a lot of folks feel the way you do about having time, but not money.</p>
<p>However, I would like to point out that there are also a lot of people (businesses/organizations) that have money, but don't have time or knowledge.</p>
<p>For this reason, I am advocating for a way to allow those who want to provide financial assistance for core, contribs or even custom, the ability to give back.</p>
<p>If the only way a person, organization or business can give back is through financial assistance, but there is no way for them to do so, they don't end up giving back at all. This hurts the community.</p>
<p>Let's take Ubercart as an example because that's what I use. I would gladly pay for additional features or support on that module because it benefits me. However, I wouldn't necessarily give back to core because that's not where my problem is. I'm left with hiring a third party developer to fix my problem and never give that back to the community because a) the maintainer doesn't want to mess with adding the fixes or b) I don't have time to add it as a contrib and then try to maintain it.</p>
<p>I strongly believe it hurts the community more than it helps and have observed this over the last 13+ years with Drupal.</p>

<p>Just so we're clear, I'm not advocating for a subscription model, or commercial model (though yes, I have suggested those options and they are widely not popular for good reason).</p>
<p>The option I think a lot of folks can get on board with is a "donation" model where the ability to give back is available, but completely optional.</p>
<p>There are a LOT of things to work out, but I think it is the most forgiving to keeping the entire platform and codebase free, but still opening an avenue for a lot of the community to give back who would otherwise never give back.</p>

<p>Though from what I've read, it seems that either Backdrop or individual contrib maintainers would need to register as a developer/organisaion in order for you to sponsor them...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256607">@BWPanda</span> hum... That only takes care of part of the problem... For example, what if someone does a lot of work on documentation and someone in the community wants to say thanks by throwing them some beer money because the steps saved them hours of figuring it out from scratch?</p>
<p>Loose example.</p>
<p>If this whole monetization thing moves forward, Backdrop needs to set the standards of what it will look like and what is expected. For example, don't come here thinking you're going to make money because that's not how it works. You come here because you want to be passionate about the project. Any funds you receive are a "thank you" from the community and gives you a reason to focus back on that project because others are also passionate about your work and want to see it continue to move forward.</p>
<p>Drupal did a great job of creating a friendly, helpful community. Backdrop is doing the same. It's the expectations of the community that molded it, and adding a monetization scheme would be no different. We just have to mold the expectation which is a lot easier when the community is small. The larger it becomes, the more difficult it is to set the expectation.</p>

<p>As food for thought on this topic, I note that the CiviCRM module (on Backdrop and other platforms) provides the download for free, but also <a href="https://civicrm.org/support-us">asks for financial support</a> in what seems like a pretty reasonable way. From our experience, when we started years ago, being able to use it for free was a very nice incentive to try it out, and then after a few years of using it, we decided it was time to support them annually by becoming a member. So it seems like providing a way to say "thank you, here's money" without making it feel negative if people don't contribute, would be a good thing.</p>

<p>My main input on this is that I want to make sure it's clear that payment isn't required and that everything is very invitational. (And even if an ask for a donation appears near the download button, an invitation to participate/join in other ways should be equally weighted).</p>

<p>Jacob certainly has made multiple efforts to have his work on Drupal be sustainable economically, frequently with negative backlash from the community.</p>

<p>I think the Drupal community has moved to the point that only enterprises are allowed to profit from it, and individuals should have a job with an enterprise if they want to be paid for their efforts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Backdrop has the same mentally: "You should work a job that pays you to use and build Backdrop". It's just on a smaller scale with a different group of clients.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> I don't think there's been one approach by the Backdrop community. I tend to lean towards finding ways to support the work. I just don't know yet what's the best approach</p>

<p>I think it might be helpful if this topic were "Financially supporting core development" rather than "Monetizing Backdrop." While I don't think it was the intention, "Monetizing Backdrop" sounds like a discussion about how to best profit off Backdrop (not that this is entirely bad). </p>
<p>I believe that the problem that we'd like to address is how to best support and reward work on core, contrib, and community development. This may or may not involve monetizing Backdrop. But, I think that monetizing Backdrop is not the right place to start.</p>

<p>Yeah, when it comes to the Drupal version of Webform specifically, but also the model of managing project maintenance in Drupal-land in general, I don't agree with the whole "it's my baby" thing ...life for the maintainer, as well the rate at which work would get done in the Webform issue queue would be much faster if that person would be willing to "let go" or simply agree to share maintenance responsibility ...my assumption (and I could be wrong about it, but still) is that this person must have "crunched the numbers" in their head, and thought that there's money to be made from the 400k sites using that module. ...I understand that in that article he talks about the hardship that he's fallen into, and I totally get how hard that must be; but it is a fact that these attempts to monetize the module did not happen just now with the whole global COVID crisis and the financial consequences it has brought along. This to me seems like a silly attempt to excuse the drive towards that end ...and I understand how hard my words and thinking may sound, but I strongly believe that open source should remain money-free at all costs, up to the point where feasible of course. ...each time money starts being involved in anything truly pure, things start going bad.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="269428">@mazze.ch</span> the blog posts are a prime example of what happens within a community when a for-profit company pulls their support and allegiance from an open-source community, usually because the open-source project is too slow to meet the demands of today's technologies.</p>
<p>Long story short, the maintainer of the D8+ webform module works as an employee for a company that used Drupal for years. They are moving away from Drupal, which means the maintainer has no financial incentive to continue working on Webform in his free time.</p>
<p>I have watched this has happen over and over in the Drupal community.</p>
<p>My argument isn't to commercialize backdrop, but instead create a financial economy around it. Drupal has suffered because of its "no money" policy within the community. All I'm saying is that Backdrop will suffer exactly as Drupal has and will see the exact same results as Drupal because of this one ideology.</p>
<p>When Drupal took on that ideology in the  early 2000s, that was the ideals of the times: 100% free for everyone! 20 years later, that landscape has changed drastically. Open source isn't about "being free", it's about sharing code and sharing code doesn't mean it can't somehow have a financial economy wrapped around it.</p>

<p>I know, I shouldn't,... but can't resist to share some general thoughts about Open Source...</p>
<p>In the Open Source ecosystem it's not uncommon that maintainers (or engaged contributors) leave a project. There are many possible reasons for that - change of interest, lack of time...</p>
<p>A proprietary (closed source) software project would certainly die with that, but not necessarily an Open Source project. Why? Because the source code is available, and anyone can fork it. If there's an interested community, someone with sufficient skills can take over. I saw this happen many times.</p>
<p>So my conclusion: it's mainly the availability of source code, that can guarantee the continuation of a project. Given that enough people are interested in the project. Payment can be nice, but is secondary IMO.</p>

<p>Thank you for the summary <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330989">@Phil Ward</span> :-) But IMHO, if Drupal 8 would have be more "backdropish" back then, Drupal would not have lost so much developers. The "there's a module for that" was possible because the entry barrier was rather low. I think that D8 and BD have taken very different directions, both of them are OK, but Backdrop is still way too small to attract commercial vendors (e.g. Theme developers) at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if Drupal 8 would have be more "backdropish" back then, Drupal would not have lost so much developers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree and would even extend that to "if Drupal 7 would have been more community-oriented...", because the step from 6 to 7 already caused many people to leave. The step from 7 to 8/9 could (worst case) turn out to be the mortal blow. At least, IMO it's a change regarding the market sector. Less projects, but (potentially) more profitable ones. Orientation towards professional market, away from community.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this also means some sort of brain drain for Drupal. Hopefully Backdrop can include at least a part of these disappointed and/or frustrated members.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I also agree on that, although I'm possibly a little more optimistic, that this might change in the future. However, that's nothing I rely on or consider necessary. For me the backbone of Backdrop is the community.</p>
<p>Another thought: a lack of interest in the community, or even worse, severe disagreement inside a community, could never get compensated with money.<br>
However, I'd appreciate sponsored contrib projects, or sponsored work on core (bugs). If vendors do it in their own interest - fine, as long as it complies with Backdrops philosophy. But that's nothing that has high prio for me in any way, it's just something that can happen and is OK.</p>

<p>Taking the option of money away from people who can only contribute financially, makes for a one-sided community. It's unfair to exclude community members from having the opportunity to help directly grow the platform because they can't give their time.</p>
<p>This topic isn't just about people in the community making money. It's more importantly about people being able to spend money to get things fixed that plague their workflow. Yes, people can spend money outside of Backdrop to get it done, but that comes with huge overhead. I know from experience.</p>

<p>I have been holding myself back from engaging in any discussions pertaining monetization, commercialization or funding Backdrop so far. Not planning to start actively participating either, because unfortunately I have other priorities at the present. I just would like to express my hope here that all kind of ideas will be welcomed, explored and some possibly even entertained; that nobody will be shut/feared off just because of strong positions of the community leaders and activists.</p>
<p>As for the above particular opinion of @klonos I do really disagree, because there are plenty of Drupal 7 projects which rely on specific contributed or custom modules and if their owners decide to financially support development of only those Backdrop projects which they need and which not necessarily fall into "non-80%" category, then it's really nobody's, but their only business. It's not really about getting those kind of projects into core or letting people/entities with money influence decisions about Backdrop project. The community can be safely growing further within the principles set by the current project leads, however at the same time I believe it would be a really big mistake to push away any parties which would like to start financially supporting - core, contributed modules, themes or whatever they only need - really doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Let's just be open-minded and explore all kind of possibilities. I said it before and I will keep repeating: Backdrop have a realistic chance to beat WordPress! However, to do so the decision-takers in Backdrop community need to be really agile.</p>

<p>Just got linked here by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> and I think it's an interesting discussion.  I think I come at it from a different angle maybe: I'm a commercial developer who is moving solely to backdrop from d7.  Honestly (try not to gasp) it's not because I want to grow backdrop or make it better.  Its because its the best tool for the job, as I see it.  </p>
<p>My clients dont really care whether I use Backdrop or something else...they just want the job done well.  That means I'll help 'fund' backdrop by doing work my clients need done, then contributing that work to make backdrop better.  It may also mean hiring developers here to get stuff done that I can't do.  </p>
<p>I think a big difference is this:  I understand the Backdrop ecosystem (like I understood D7) so my 'funding' would never be to scratch my specific itch (ie. a non-80% feature) that goes against 'how things should be done'.  I work within the framework, so everything I do would be 'selfish' (its not really 'for the good of the community', it's because I make money, my clients get websites), but at the same time its good for backdrop.  </p>
<p>I guess I'd say dont assume everyone wants to help backdrop for the sake of backdrop (writing off those who contribute for 'selfish' reasons).  Most 'commercial' devs will help because its good for them AND for backdrop. I want backdrop to succeed because it's good for me AND good for the community.  Sometimes I feel like that perspective is missed and that everyone is supposed to be working on improving the project selflessly. (ie. for free)  To those who do that I have MAJOR respect...but thats not me, for better or worse..and it wasn't the case with D7 either.</p>

<p>I guess I don't understand the issue fully.  I don't see why it matters how/why people are contributing.  Are we just talking about money influencing the direction of the project?  Without them being able to directly affect core, I guess I dont understand the problem.  If they want to make wacky/stupid modules, that scratch their own itch,  is that a problem?</p>

<p>This, however, makes sense to me.  Its more about using money to influence overall project direction, as opposed to being paid to work in Backdrop, then contributing.  I think those are 2 different things (so maybe I was misunderstanding the whole discussion)</p>

<p>I think the main consensus is "don't let money dictate the outcome of Backdrop". I agree with this as well but it wasn't clear in the beginning.</p>
<p>There are a few other issues to discuss and work through, but the discussion has stared to take shape such that we have some pin-pointed talking points to work around.</p>

<p>Yup, makes sense. I know 'core people' can't say this (because its not politically correct), but I can:  This was the sickness that happened in Drupal.  I was constantly disgusted by the influence of Acquia on the whole thing.  And, in the end, IMO thats why D8 sucked and I left. :)</p>

<p>I feel like the question is more about who the leaders / project leads are.  If theyre not people who are going to monetize Backdrop for their own gain, then the project is safe from influence.</p>

<p>It is actually really nice question. Even-though we all know that de-facto historically, culturally, code-wise Backdrop is and will be for long time died up to Drupal, I believe it would be really good if it started to aim the much larger market of WordPress, and accordingly start making changes that would make easier to reach out to WordPress users. At least UI-wise.</p>

<p>Honestly I think this is my fear:  Personally I don't believe any system at this point can 'compete' with Wordpress.  Its too big and has already captured the market, plus its SO UI oriented that its target market basically rules out custom development (not completely, but pratically).  </p>
<p>Personally I feel like Backdrop should serve a market thats in-between.  That was the power of D7, the failing of D8 and the downfall of Wordpress.  It should be totally accessible for custom devs to build complex custom sites, while being 'simple enough' that custom-needs-oriented folks can build cool stuff in the UI.  I feel like it has a chance to sit in this really nice space in between that nobody really serves.  Its not for Computer Scientists...but it's also not for people that know so little that they're the target market of Wordpress (or squrespace for that matter)</p>
<p>Thats just my 2 cents.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298007">@Rob Feature</span> I agree with your thoughts. You see, if Backdrop started to make changes towards WordPress market, it wouldn't arrive there soon, instead it would end up just where you want it to be: somewhere in-between.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see that.  However, I also could see it serving nobody.   It wouldn't do UI stuff as well as Wordpress, and there might be alot of barriers put up to custom development by having complicated UI-related functionality.   I feel like this was where D7 was headed but (luckily) never got:  It poured a ton of effort into trying to compete with Wordpress UI-built layouts, but it couldn't really do it.  It was frankly too hard/time consuming to catch up.  So instead we ended up with things like Panels that, once installed, just inhibit simpler development.</p>

<p>I think that this ties in very heavily with the monitization issue. I know lots of people who have built Wordpress sites or are looking into that because a service they paid for is only available through a Wordpress plugin. They do not know of care about Wordpress at all they just know that someone said a Wordpress plugin would solve their business requirements.<br>
We currently cannot do that because people think that you should not be allowed to pay module developers for the modules they maintain.</p>

<p>Personal opinion: I'm not against people getting paid for developing modules but I am against an ecosystem that encourages separate payments (especially recurring subscriptions) for each module needed, with each developer trying to build their own monetized silo in one way or another. Heavily in favor of people getting paid to spend time improving a module and then releasing those improvements to the project/module without additional fee. Relatedly, I'm also not a fan of Freemium/Premium type plugins that try to bait and switch. I get the arguments about attracting developers with the promise of module-subscription-based cash but since I don't like that outcome for the ecosystem... I'm not as young as I used to be but hey, still got some of that idealism. <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>Of course. As an active member of the Backdrop community, I like being involved in discussions and decision-making. Virtual meetings are a struggle for me, because of timezone differences and family life/commitments. I've made my peace with generally missing the weekly meetings as at least they're recorded and I can watch them after the fact. But when I can't attend other virtual events/discussions and they're not recorded, then it really does feel like I'm missing out, and there's nothing I can do about it other than beg people to fill me in later...</p>

<p>I literally was about to say what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="262176">@jackaponte</span> said ^^ ...no decision was made (nor did anyone think that it was to be made) during that discussion.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256570">@StPaulTim</span> Ok and understood.</p>
<p>I have opened a new topic around the discussion about creating a new github group that can house all things that aren't there to fix code or the text on the sites. I personally feel that <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> queue should be reserved for the site issues and there should be a new group for "organization/community" issues. Otherwise, the <a href="http://backdropcms.org">backdropcms.org</a> queue becomes too cluttered with site vs community issues and it becomes difficult to distinguish between the site and the community.</p>
