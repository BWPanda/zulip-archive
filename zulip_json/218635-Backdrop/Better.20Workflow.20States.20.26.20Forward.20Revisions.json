It's not clear to me, that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"258586\">@Nate Lampton</span> was inherently against larger changes, if they make sense. </p>\n<p>It seems to be, that if we took the concerns he was raising at the time very literally, we would have taken this PR is a very different direction. While <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"258586\">@Nate Lampton</span> has not explicitly endorsed this proposal. He is very much aware of the discussions we were having and I assume he has at least skimmed the text and seen some of the screenshots</p>",
