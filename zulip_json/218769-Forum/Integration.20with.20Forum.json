This can be useful | If you have an email that you want to discuss on Zulip | For mirroring mailing list traffic | For integrating a third-party app that can send emails, but which does not easily lend itself to a more direct integration | If you're planning on doing this in an automated way, and have some programming experience, another option is to use our send message API. | The email subject will become the Zulip topic, and the email body will become the Zulip message.</div></div></div>",
