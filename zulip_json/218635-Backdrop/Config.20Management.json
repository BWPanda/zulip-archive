By that I mean, do as might many D7 web admins do, and work off the GUI/front end, without using drush, or other tools.<br>\nI suggest as much to highlight the issues that arise, for example, when trying to import a config from a local server instance.<br>\nE.g. I had repeated errors of one module breaking the import synchronization -- it was the footnotes module. I had it enabled. Still failing. I eventually enabled all sections -- footnotes in views, Footnotes Wysiwyg, and footnotes blocks. Even though my local instances on my local server did not have those enabled. <br>\nThere were other examples. Eventually I gave up, and just copied the local server active json files into the production active directory. But I'm not sufficiently technical to know what errors that might induce down the track.<br>\nI'm concerned that many D7 admins who aren't all that technical  - when encountering such difficulties -- will reconsider BD, and instead move to WP. <br>\nIn business circles, there is a saying - the number one rule is \"make it easy for the customer\".  If you make it hard, many will not complain, they'll just move away (to WP).<br>\nI understand that a major focus of the BD team, is to make it easy to use Backdrop, like WP. Hence my suggestion , to make like a non-technical D7 admin, to 'flesh out' the road-blocks.</p>",

All good.  </p>\n<p>That said, the statistics module is not integrated with Views, so I'm currently wondering if I can set up Rules (fire on node viewed) to increment a counter (field on node), so that I can use Views (block) and sort on counter, to replicate D7 blocks that sort according to popularity (for my personal use on local server, not public -- I keep a 800+ node database of research that I like to order according to what I find most relevant, aka popular with moi).</p>",
