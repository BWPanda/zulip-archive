Rather than adding Testimonials to the main menu, I'd like to display it on the About page as a seperate tab (e.g. click About in menu go to page with two tab; first selected is About node, second is Testimonials and shows that view when clicked). These would be seperate from the View/Edit/etc. tabs, don't want to mess with those. Any ideas how best to do this?</p>",
