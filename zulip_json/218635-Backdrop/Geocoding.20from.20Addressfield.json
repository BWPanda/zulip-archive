Having said that, the <a href=\"http://d.org\">d.org</a> article you've linked to seems to purposely provide instructions that allow visitors to manually set their location. My assumption is that in order to have the automatic location detection work, you'd need to make sure that the browser and also the operating system setting that permits tracking people's location is enabled. If those are disabled, then you'd need to have a way to allow people to manually set their location.</p>",
