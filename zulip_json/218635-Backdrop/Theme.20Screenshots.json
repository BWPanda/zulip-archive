I just released a new version - with a new screenshot - and the release zip file <em>ships</em> with the new screenshot, but it wasn't updated in the regular install. I ran the normal Backdrop update via web UI. Anyone else experiencing this?</p>\n<p>Background for this: I'm unhappy with the awkward display of theme screenshots on b-org (scale-and-crop). Personally, I don't think it's optimal for theme promotion, if the only images people can see are those cropped mini images.</p>",
