That was there.  I got it working through a lot of trial and error.  part of the problem was the path.  I'm now struggling with where the No Results text can go.   I'll post everything when I'm done in here and when I get time, where should I write a post on how to do this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who will want to and the instructions really don't cover this.  Taxonomy views were a piece of cake comparatively.

I will try to get to it next week, while it's still fresh in my memory.  It also might be useful to add to documentation, but that should be decided when I'm done with the post.
