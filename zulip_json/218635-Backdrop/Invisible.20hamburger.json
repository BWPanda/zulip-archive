If you have the debugger, check the location.  I've found the best css uses position absolute with a top and right, and at least 2% padding to allow for the scroll bars.</p>\n<p>Here's a sample of css from one of my sites (bear in mind that it's very theme-dependent)<br>\n.menu-toggle-button  {<br>\n  position: absolute;<br>\n  top: -8em;<br>\n  right: 20%;<br>\n  z-index: 999;<br>\n  margin-top:1%;<br>\n  }</p>",

No need to buy anything!  Also, it might be hidden because of the z-index!  That's important.</p>",

It doesn't look like it's toggling the element state correctly in the subtheme.  I have another site using Basis and it works fine on the iphone.  I made some debugging  suggestions (go back to Basis, reach out to subtheme developer if it isn't custom), start commenting stuff out, etc.  I'm betting if he switches back to Basis, the hamburger will work properly.</p>",
