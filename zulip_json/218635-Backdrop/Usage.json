There's a drupal module that allows you to export the full URL (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/image_url_formatter\">https://www.drupal.org/project/image_url_formatter</a>) in views - use rewrite.  Someone else here explained to me how to do it exactly and it works great).  Once you do that, then the mapping on the input for feeds that you have will work.</p>",
