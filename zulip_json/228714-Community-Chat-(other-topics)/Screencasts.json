Linux doesn't have a good video editor for professional use. The last editor I discovered and so far am pretty happy with it is \"olive video editor\". It's still in alpha but stable enough. I have version 0.1 (April 2019 | Alpha | 1e3cf53) which is stable. I tried the most recent version 0.2 but was unstable.</p>",
