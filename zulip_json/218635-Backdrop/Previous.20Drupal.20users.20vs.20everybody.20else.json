We've been trying (I think) to not disrupt the views of those coming from Drupal too much, while that has been the source of most of our users, but that will probably (hopefully?) change at some point.</p>\n<p>My feeling is that we should diverge from Drupal more, and treat Drupal transfers as a special case, with some sort of \"Hey Drupal people, here is what you need to know\" content. And then optimize the experience for people who have never used Drupal.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I started the thought on git in case it sounds a little out of place:</p>\n<p>I think long term we should offer two, maybe 3 base profiles OOTB.</p>\n<p>1) A site that is almosy ready to go, it just needs content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home page with a content block or content node (this issue)</li>\n<li>About page (already in the current profile)</li>\n<li>Contact page (do we use the basic Drupal contact form?)</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) A mock-up site that is a sandbox for new users. Lots of organized pages with tags, views, pictures etc. Sometimes having a working environment you can tinker with and not worry about messing up is a great way to learn. I could imagine a \"reset\" button that would take a person back to the choose profile option and blow away all of the sandbox profile stuff and re-initialize it for a site or bare bones profile.</p>\n<p>3) A bare bones site where nothing is configured (minimal profile in Drupal terms)</p>\n<p>Now, I would put this profile page as a separate page during install and list the options as cards (like how you choose layout templates) with a title and brief description of who it's for.</p>\n<p>Ok, so all of that to address @BWPanda suggestion of a view to show latest content, I would add this to the \"sandbox\" profile, not the standard \"site\" profile.</p>\n<p>Thinking about profiles, why not distinguish BD away from Drupal by offering \"profiles\" at  install where someone can choose a community created profile? Modules, Themes, Profiles. I kinda hijacked the thread but wanted to give something to think about in the various discussions floating around.</p>",
