We've done it this way pretty successfully.  I've got one in development now that I've had to put on the back burner because it's a nonpaying job, but we had no problems.  I'm in the look and feel stage with that one - the export/import went well.   I always do migrations because we're typically redesigning / updating the site at the same time.  D6 layout/design is pretty outdated now.  Also - safer.    Just a note,  I changed content types in D6 before I exported so that I could streamline.  For example - Simplenews newsletters became articles.  (I stopped using simplenews so these are back issues).  <br>\nD6 - node export is the module used.   Also, no desire to mess with live production sites while in development.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth  </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"256627\">oadaeh (Jason Flatt)</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/218635-Backdrop/topic/moving.20from.20D6/near/190030120\" title=\"#narrow/stream/218635-Backdrop/topic/moving.20from.20D6/near/190030120\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@_<strong>Jen Lampton</strong> has done and recommended the D6 -&gt; D7 -&gt; Backdrop path several times, so I assume that's the canonical way.</p>\n</blockquote>",
