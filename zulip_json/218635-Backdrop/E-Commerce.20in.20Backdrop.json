However, porting Commerce makes no sense IMO, it requires a lot of other modules to be ported, and the concept feels more and more outdated. I am not even sure if I should migrate the other shops to D9, it seems that Commerce 2.x can't keep up with the pace of the market. Important things still do not work properly.</p>",

Commerce was only used by 2 of our clients. One went out of business because the store was too expensive for them.  The other is still using Commerce but it's the payment portion of CRM Core, which has been a real disappointment.  It was a lovely alternative to CiVicRM when it came out, but it was quickly abandoned within a year or two of it's release.  That's a D7 client that will probably go to a custom solution like SalsaLabs when it's time to move, If I can get them to spend the money.  That is the level of functionality they want, but don't have the budget for.  The other was a custom printed T-shirt business that needed commerce for the way they sold the T-shirts. It turned out they couldn't afford the site though, so ...  We got the basics up for them, but they couldn't maintain it and quit.</p>",
