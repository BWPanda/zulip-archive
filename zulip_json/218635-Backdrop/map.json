Do you mean \"Geofield Map\"? I'm not sure if Geofield Map is supposed to display more than one markers. I never used it before and don't get it to display any map. Leaflet views at least produces maps with multiple markers on it. But I'm more familiar with that as I use it with Drupal regularly.</p>",
