<p>Inexcusable question on my part, but is Boxton the only layout template that has support for full width hero blocks in its top region?</p>

<p>Hm. doesn't that depend on the theme?</p>
<p>For sure all flexible layout templates have settings for that via "Configure row" / "Row width behavior ".</p>

<p>Yep, flexible templates allow that, which is actually my point ...if you try to change the home page layout on a vanilla installation to another template, say to one that provides a sidebar, then the hero block remains in the respective "Top" region, but it loses its full-width-ness. I see that as an unexpected WTF.</p>

<p>I see the point (WTF). It really seems that most, if not all core layouts except Boxton wrap everything in "container" class, which prevents them from being full-width.<br>
But I don't think that we can change that now, as this would break things for existing sites. <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span> And there are alternatives available (flexible templates)</p>

<p>If I'm following this correctly, this jumps out to me as a serious limitation.  Full-width images (and other content) seems like a critical capability for a broad category of websites.  I feel that being able to create them should be the default.  If it's true that only one of the built-in layouts supports this, I propose we change that.  Is there a way to add full-width capability while maintaining backwards compatibility?</p>

<p>That's a solution for experts, but non-gurus will never find that.  I think this capability should be in core.</p>
<p>Sample size of one, but I've tried unsuccessfully to create full-width blocks in Backdrop in the recent past.  I wasn't able to, but I assumed I just didn't know how.  It never occurred to me that it might be impossible without adding customizations.</p>

<p>Not so sure I agree. Backdrop and Drupal are both built to be modular. If a person cannot find an add-on layout, assume they cant find any additional module or theme. That would mean we have a much bigger problem on our hands.</p>

<p>The problem here is the wrappers in our current core layouts. We have a big <code>container</code> class with a width restriction, and all the rows are in that. The Hero layouts swap this, to have a wrapper that can be overridden to have no margins, and each row has the fixed width <code>container</code> class <em>within</em> the row. It would be a simple change to do this, and then we could as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256729">@klonos</span> suggested, just park the current ones in the legacy folder.</p>
