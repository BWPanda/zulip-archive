        "content": "<p>Personally, I would love to see a generic \"type\" that can have an alias path field added to it. When I brought this up, I was told there is too much old code that would cause major rewrites to have to happen so it was pretty much a hard no.</p>\n<p>But anywho, I do like the approach Drupal took with converting blocks to entities which allows fieldable blocks. I think Backdrop makes it a LOT easier to handle fieldable content with layouts though so a content type could always be used for this proposed purpose. I guess I'm good either way?</p>\n<p>I wouldn't mind seeing core handle a few basic blocks OOTB though like an image block for quick galleries, a table block etc. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"263951\">@jenlampton</span> said we should just build them using content types and views, but I don't like that approach due to the overhead to make it work. 30+ min to create a gallery using a content type, views, configuration etc vs 25 seconds to upload 10 images and place the block done.</p>\n<p>As usual I'm hijacking the topic with random ideas.
