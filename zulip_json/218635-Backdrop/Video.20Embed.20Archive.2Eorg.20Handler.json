Thanks!</p>",

One of the things you can do before you start is post issues in the Drupal issues and Backdrop-opts/contrib issues queue <a href=\"https://api.backdropcms.org/converting-from-drupal#communicate\">per here</a>, which can help people discover if you're already working on a port (or, as now, have one completed).</p>\n<p>Once you've created a release for your module, it should appear automatically on the <a href=\"https://backdropcms.org/modules\">Backdrop modules page</a>.</p>",
