That's not surprising, since they were presumably written for earlier version of Bootstrap, and they probably all used LESS and not SASS.   I wonder if there are similar tools available that work with current versions?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several third-party generators are also available on the Web. Unlike the official generator, they provide live previews as you adjust variables. Bootswatchr organizes itself by variable, and StyleBootstrap by component. BootTheme adds a roll-the-dice feature to randomize your values. If lady luck isn’t on your side, Lavish can generate a theme from any image you provide, and PaintStrap from existing color schemes.</p>\n</blockquote>",
